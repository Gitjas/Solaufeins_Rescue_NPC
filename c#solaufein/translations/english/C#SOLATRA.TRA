@7    = ~(growls) Finally! I started doubting you would be true to your word and actually come for me, after that excessive talk you had with those surface elves.~ [UDSOLA07]
@8    = ~You recognize me?~
@9    = ~Good to see you again!~
@10   = ~The elves were suspicious against us, too, Solaufein.~
@11   = ~Watch your tone, will you?~
@12   = ~I waited alone at this place long enough for sure.~
@13   = ~And the cursed sun is up, too!~
@14   = ~Yes, they are very suspicious. Quite comprehensible from their point of view, I can't hold it against them.~
@15   = ~I phrased my discomfort, nothing more.~
@16   = ~Already I regret the descision to wait here for you. After the distraction you caused, sneaking by the elves was easy enough, though.~
@17   = ~I already told you I did not succeed in getting the surface armor I was mentioning before. And my drow equipment turned to dust... as expected.~
@18   = ~That's no problem. I will equip you accordingly.~
@19   = ~Calm down. You are unsettled, I understand.~
@20   = ~Do you want to come along or do you prefer having a conversation?~
@21   = ~Two lousy knives is all you got? You've got to be kidding.~
@22   = ~Hmph. We'll see how appropriate the armory of the surface will be. I am still waiting to see one that can compete to the ones I am used to.~
@23   = ~Come, take your place.~
@24   = ~Proud words!~
@25   = ~Feel free to spread that dust you've got there over your torso, if you prefer.~
@26   = ~I have no use for you now, you'll have to wait a bit longer.~
@27   = ~You are right. I apologize for my arrogance. Here even the lousiest leather armor is better than any plate mail of adamantite. And I can call myself lucky if you'll provide me with one.~
@28   = ~With pleasure.~
@29   = ~You should not let me wait too long here in the sun. Unless you prefer me well done!~
@30   = ~Can I join you now?~
@31   = ~No.~
@32   = ~Hm, truth be told, this opportunity is far too tempting. Let's see how long you can withstand with only two silly knifes!~
@33   = ~Hmph.~
@34   = ~(snort!) Sure, I really enjoy kidding if it puts my life into danger.~
@35   = ~There you are again!~
@36   = ~You are attacking me? I can't believe my own naivite. No, I do not have to fight all battles. Least one that puts the odds against me!~
@37   = ~You are even more perfidious than I thought. We will not meet again, surfacer.~
@38   = ~Yes, 'Veldrin'. I already took a good look at you, when the silver dragon took you to the exit.~
@39   = ~Can I join you again?~
@40   = ~Hmph. I'll let you know when I'm well done roasting.~
@41   = ~Hmph. If you say so.~
@42   = ~You want us to go separate ways?~
@43   = ~Wait for me here.~
@44   = ~No, stay with the group, Solaufein.~
@45   = ~Veldrin! For whatever reason you are attacking me, so be it!~
@46   = ~Veldrin! ...Or whatever your name would be. You made it out of the temple and the city alive! You are indeed impressive.~
@47   = ~You are on your way to the silver dragon now, are you not?~
@48   = ~Is this an ambush?~
@49   = ~Why do you want to know? Your question arouses suspicion!~
@50   = ~I felt the shock going through the city. The house Despana fell, even though not everyone might have noticed yet.~
@51   = ~I could not remain in the shadows. The more I see from you, the more amazing you are.~
@52   = ~That is what I suspected.~
@53   = ~You fooled the whole city... And again a megalomaniac matron mother fell by her own arrogance and pride, and the drow were put in their place.~
@54   = ~You know, we are preparing for war... For war against the surfacers. Ha! I needed to make sure it was indeed the silver dragon you are working for. It is her last definite move to show my fatuous people their limits.~
@55   = ~May your escape from the Underdark be a successful one... or wherever you wished to go from here. Curiousity fills me to see your true form, but I should not linger, least in the open. So, I will go back to...~
@56   = ~Wait, who is approaching? Cursed it be, I was too careless! Veldrin, quick, draw your weapons, it's the...~
@57   = ~Solaufein! Treacherous spy! So I did notice correctly that you maggot sneaked around in the dark corners of the city's streets!~
@58   = ~*Me* you were following? ...You are not aware of what happened in the city since you left in my pursuit, are you?~
@59   = ~I know the matron mother executes a dangerous ritual for which the doors were sealed. But I also know that the protection of your house lapsed!~
@60   = ~...Indeed. Veldrin, stay out of this. She was so determined to catch me, the renegate, that she seems oblivious to anything else.~
@61   = ~Well then, Imrae. You found me. I laugh into your face, because you are as badly off as me - only you are still ignorant of it!~
@62   = ~Be quiet, little maggot! How do you dare speak to me? But it is unimportant. You will come with me. Your fate is sealed! You will give a fine drider, indeed!~
@63   = ~...Drider? No! No!... Kill! You are supposed to kill me! Feed me to the spiders!...~
@64   = ~Now you squirm properly, male!~
@65   = ~Veldrin, do not let this happen. Follow us! Look into the crevice beside the bridge, you will find a...~
@66   = ~Silence, maggot! I heard your voice long enough!~
@67   = ~Solaufein's Rescue

Solaufein, the male fighter captain whos life I spared, waited for me outside the drow city. There he was discovered and arrested by a maiden of Lolth, unfortunately. She seemed not to be aware of the recent ongoings inside the city, much to my advantage. Solaufein however, she took with her to the drider chambers somewhere down here. 
If I want to spare Solaufein the fate of being turned into a drider, I should follow them and free him! He tried to tell me something about a hidden crevice beside the bridge near Adalon's lair. I should look inside to see what is in there.
And I should decide whether I want to bring the Silver Lady her eggs as soon as possible. How long does such a transformation to a drider take?...~
@68   = ~Vel'uss zhah doerin? *Kivvin*! Elgg mina!~
@69   = ~Who is this? What are you doing here? You are not supposed to be here!~
@70   = ~Veldrin!~
@71   = ~I... I thank you. You freed me from the drider cocoon! You found the rune stone, as I hoped.~
@72   = ~How are you?~
@73   = ~Indeed. I hope I get a reward for this!~
@74   = ~I just happen to come by.~
@75   = ~Ol zhah dos?... It is you, is it not? Surfacer... Now I see your true look.~
@76   = ~(snort!) If a pair of rosty knives and a rather old surface armor is to your liking - because that would be all I could offer you from here.~
@77   = ~What a friendly question... after you had to rescue me from my own stupidity. To answer it: I am well, considering the circumstances, Veldrin.~
@78   = ~You just came by? So, you found the rune stone giving you pass to the drider chambers, killed the present drow, and opened my cocoon, all by accident? What lucky accident for me, indeed, Veldrin.~
@79   = ~(snort!) This name is not appropriate any more. I should not use it. Forgive me.~
@80   = ~Dear Imrae was so decided to bring me in she indeed missed the recent happenings inside the city. As soon as we arrived here she was ordered back to her house. I assume we won't see here too soon again, if ever. Everyone belonging to the former house Despana is occupied with other problems now!~
@81   = ~You freed me just in time. The transformation did not start yet, as they did not put me into a cocoon right away, but... Never mind. It is over. You saved me from becoming an abomination, and I have nothing but my thanks in return. (snort!) Thankfulness of a drow, what a great reward.~
@82   = ~We already agreed on meeting at the surface. I will go there now, if you still want me to join you.~
@83   = ~Yes, Solaufein. I will expect you there, just as we agreed in front of the Ust Natha's city gates!~
@84   = ~No, this experience changed you. I prefer you as you are now.~
@85   = ~I will await you there. Be assured, you will not hear from what happened here ever again.~
@86   = ~Do you, indeed?~
@87   = ~I would like to give you are reward, but I have nothing of value... I will go back hiding into the shadows. My hopes are high that the fall of house Despana stirred so much tension my existence will no longer be of interest.~
@88   = ~On second thought, I would prefer you how you were before, when we agreed to meet at the surface.~
@89   = ~I would like you to join me, Solaufein, but with the experiences you made here in the drider chambers.~
@90   = ~I would like you to join me, Solaufein. Come with me!~
@91   = ~I wish you luck, Solaufein. Fare well!~
@92   = ~Well, then be off!~
@93   = ~I would come with you?~
@94   = ~You... you are not serious, <CHARNAME>?~
@95   = ~Think careful about taking a drow into the group, <CHARNAME>.~
@96   = ~Hmm, darf elf has dark skin of evil drow, but Minsc is not sure if this one needs butt kicking. What do you think, Boo?~
@97   = ~Hmm, darf elf has dark skin of evil drow, but Minsc is not sure if this one needs butt kicking.~
@98   = ~Oh yes, wonderful idea. We 'enforce' this group by taking on a weakened, unarmed renegade.~
@99   = ~Well, his character seems to be different to most drow, indeed. But we shouldn't take the "helping others" too far, you know...~
@100  = ~Bah! Don't fool yourself by planning on taking a drow on his first trip into the surface sunlight! This male won't be anything more than a nuisance, and slow us down remarkably.~
@101  = ~I am undecided in this matter.~
@102  = ~Are you sure, <CHARNAME>? I know he was helpful and all, but still...~
@103  = ~Do you seriously consider taking this drow on?! Keep in mind that his presence will make us a target to all kinds of hostilities - being hunted by his own kind included!~
@104  = ~Ha! You are truly the savior of all fallen and renegates. I won't be part of the complications his presence will undoubtedly resolve in!~
@105  = ~Deliberate about this decision well, <CHARNAME>. His presence will raise tensions - and with that I am not only referring to the ones we will encounter from others.~
@106  = ~No, <PRO_RACE>. Your true nature is no secret. Even with your help until now you represent what I am trying to leave behind me.~
@107  = ~Why would you want me to join you? Because I proved to be such a good and vigilant warrior? (snort!)~
@108  = ~How did you imagine this to happen? Do you expect me to leave my realm because I am being hunted - and go to the surface, unprotected, unable to blend in, to be hunted there?~
@109  = ~And yet, your offer is intriguing. I have no doubt my chance of finding like-minded drow in Ust Natha is currently very little, with all of us goaded and full of blood thirst... And travel to other drow cities is long, with no prove I will be more sufficient in hiding there, if I failed so miserable here.~
@110  = ~I... am inclined on taking on your offer. Much I heard about your world, yet never I was there. Not like this, accompanying a surfacer. Leaving the Underdark offers so many possibilities...~
@111  = ~I could meet with the few drow who turned their back on our evil siblings. I... I could meet true followers of Eilistraee. Yes. This is what I want.~
@112  = ~This would be my only condition for you, surfacer. That you grant me this.~
@113  = ~Come again? Do you think *I* could organize a meeting with Drizzt Do'Urden? How about a reality check?!~
@114  = ~Finding true followers of Eilistraee? Hm, I would have to inquire first, but that should be possible.~
@115  = ~It's not up to you to make demands, drow. Join me or leave it.~
@116  = ~Of course not. I spoke of followers of Eilistraee as they exist on the surface. Starting from there I will find what I seek.~
@117  = ~I thank you!~
@118  = ~Before you join up I should tell you that I am chasing a mighty enemy. Maybe you saw him. He was an ally of house Despana for your war against the surface elves.~
@119  = ~I am chasing a mighty mage who took my soul.~
@120  = ~Well then!~
@121  = ~Very good. This will suffice.~
@122  = ~Your soul? I surely heard about much less relevent reasons for a chase!~
@123  = ~I will regain my strength and be of use to you. But I have no illusions: Travelling with you on the surface, I will be in need of you giving me shelter. Are you willing to grant it to me?~
@124  = ~Yes, Solaufein.~
@125  = ~Do you need my protection? You can leave and go elsewhere any time, you know.~
@126  = ~I am not doing this out of charity, Solaufein. I expect you to fight for my goals, while you are travelling under my protection.~
@127  = ~No, I don't need anyone burdening me. Better we go separate ways!~
@128  = ~You showed here as well as in Ust Natha readiness to support me even if it would be a risk to you - although why is still a mystery to me.~
@129  = ~Hmph. I will be very vulnerable where you are going to. Never would I risk such a thing without your company! But you are right, I wouldn't need your protection to survive, not here, not at the surface, either.~
@130  = ~So I will join forces with a surfacer, then.~
@131  = ~But you are under the spell of the Silver Lady, still. She won't want to see me...~
@132  = ~When do you want me to meet up with you?~
@133  = ~I want you to come with me right away.~
@134  = ~Could you follow us unobtrusively until we are at the surface?~
@135  = ~Are you asking because I hid so efficiently only recently, yes? (snort!) But yes, I should be able to do that.~
@136  = ~I wish the same to you, surfacer.~
@137  = ~I will not go with you. As fascinating as the idea sounds, it does not withstand reality.~
@138  = ~I will.~
@139  = ~I thank you. Shall you get into trouble in the Underdark and I would be nearby, I will not forget your mercy!~
@140  = ~And if the silver dragon turns you back to your original form, are you ready to explain my presence to her? I have no intention of facing this mighty creature. None of my seemingly good deeds of the last days can ever undo the cruelty we brought upon her.~
@141  = ~I do not wish to accompany you right away, <CHARNAME>. Do not worry. I have learnt my lesson. No handmaiden of Lolth will catch me again.~
@142  = ~I will go on a quick stroll and collect the things I hid in the caves. It is not my intention to join you without any equipment!~
@143  = ~You go ahead. I will meet with you then.~
@144  = ~Keep them distracted with your noisy surfacer trampling. This will give me enough opportunity to follow you unnoticed. We will meet again at the surface. I will wait for you there!~
@145  = ~<CHARNAME>! Wait. I know we agreed upon meeting at the surface, but I thought about it and changed my mind. I want to join you now.~
@146  = ~Here I am, <CHARNAME>. Your way through the drow posts was impressing. I would have met up with you sooner, but you were surprisingly fast - or I was too slow. You did not need my help, so much is clear.~
@147  = ~Going past the elf posts unnoticed wouldn't be a problem, not for me as one single drow, used to hide in the shadows. But I want to enter the surface honestly and openly - do you see? I am sick of hiding. If the elves won't have me, at least the pathetic play would come to a quick ending.~
@148  = ~But I did not succeed in getting the surface armor I was mentioning before. I should have refrained my pride in this regard, I am standing in front of you as defenseless as I was after climbing out of that drider cocoon.~
@149  = ~Of course, you are welcome to join.~
@150  = ~I like this. Join in then.~
@151  = ~A quick ending? It would give *me* the troubles if the elves would grow suspicious or hostile on your behalf!~
@152  = ~I am sorry, but I can't take you with me now.~
@153  = ~Which is the reason why I would like to go in your company - because I am intelligent enough to know that I wouldn't last a minute if stepping into the open on my own.~
@154  = ~No thanks, I fought enough battles already. I have no interest in risking another due to a misunderstanding. You'll need to find your own way to the surface.~
@155  = ~This is a step you'll need to take on your own, Solaufein.~
@156  = ~(snort!) So much for my nobel approach. But I have understanding for your answer - I would have done the same, on your account. I will follow you quietly then. Search me outside of the elven camp.~

//c#solauJ.d
@157  = ~So I did emerge to the surface with you. I left a society where I could be commanded to and fro, humiliated without reason, and punished for a naught. This I left behind, or so I am hoping. Tell me, what are your plans for us from here?~ [c#ablank]
@158  = ~I am chasing a powerful mage who stole my soul.~
@159  = ~I'm in search of the man who helped inciting the drow for war against the surface elves. He did terrible things to me.~
@160  = ~Pfeh. I point, you fight. You don't need to know anything more.~
@161  = ~You think so?~
@162  = ~Well, I will follow you then, <CHARNAME> from the surface.~
@163  = ~Yes, so you told me before.~
@164  = ~Your soul?!~
@165  = ~Hm, and in these circumstances you want to burden your company with a drow?~
@166  = ~And more than one.~
@167  = ~You seem to be certain to be able to handle the problems araising from travelling with drow.~
@168  = ~Terrible things?~
@169  = ~Yes, he stole my soul!~
@170  = ~Torture, to be precise.~
@171  = ~You don't need to know any details.~
@172  = ~I need your protection, and I will show my appreciation for the help you grant me, and fight for your cause.~
@173  = ~But let me phrase it plainly: I expect from my time here with you, that I will become familiar with life on the surface. I want to find supporters for my personal endeavor: to lead the drow back on the right path. I was weakened and I fled. But I will regain my strength, and I will return.~
@174  = ~That is a noble goal, Solaufein. I feel honored by your presence, and I hope that you will achieve what you aim for.~
@175  = ~That is alright - I do something for you, you'll do something for me.~
@176  = ~Be warned, drow. Don't you think you could abandon me somewhere you think it fit. Remember, I am watching you.~
@177  = ~These are very friendly words... I lack experience to know whether they are truly meant.~
@178  = ~Then we are of one mind.~
@179  = ~That is wise of you, I won't blame you. It is a high risk you are takig, traveling with a drow.~
@180  = ~I thank you for the protection you are providing me with. I'm not planning on imposing on your kindness.~
@181  = ~My magic decreased significantly since I left the Underdark, <CHARNAME>. It is... unsettling, if not frightening.~ [c#ablank]
@182  = ~Which abilities did you lose?~
@183  = ~Your honesty surprises me. Doesn't this contradict the drowish way of never to show a weakness?~
@184  = ~I think you are still very strong, Solaufein.~
@185  = ~You'll have to get used to it.~
@186  = ~You call it frightening?~
@187  = ~To list them all is pointless, but what I did lose are abilities I took for granted.~
@188  = ~No, it doesn't, because you are my leader and you will notice my weakness in the next fight, <CHARNAME>, and so it is the wiser choice to tell you about it now.~
@189  = ~In addition to my lost magic there is my blindness in this bright sunlight. I... did not exaggerate when I asked for your protection, <CHARNAME>.~
@190  = ~You still have it, I assure you.~
@191  = ~This honesty is one of the things I like on you, Solaufein.~
@192  = ~Get a grip on yourself, will you?~
@193  = ~I do not plan on remaining this weak! The followers of Eilistraee living at the surface, are they weak and blind? I will overcome these impairments, too... Eventually.~
@194  = ~But it is fitting, you know. The moment I am able to actually *see* our enemies, they are so up close that fighting them with magic would be of no advantage anyway!...~
@195  = ~It is good I know that you are a capable fighter, or else I would be worried concerning our fighting prowess.~
@196  = ~It's not like I could hide it. And I do not think it wise to pretend it would leave me unmoved. I am an experienced fighter and used to deprivations of multiple sorts. I can handle the restrictions the sun puts on me, but losing my magic is something else completely.~
@197  = ~Even a drow knows when pretending would turn into a bad idea!~
@198  = ~So, you are a child of Bhaal? I know Alaundo's Prophecies. The ones saying that the Bhaal spawn will turn the Sword Coast into chaos...~ [c#ablank]
@199  = ~Yes, I am.~
@200  = ~Sounds familiar, yes...~
@201  = ~Seems like everyone gets to know this sooner or later.~
@202  = ~Why would it be of importance?~
@203  = ~It is no wonder these prophecies found their way into the Underdark. Firstly, there are Bhaal spawn among the drow, too... and secondly, we drow wouldn't be who we are if we wouldn't try to use such a time to our own advantage.~
@204  = ~But I was asking about you I know the one we are pursuing stole you soul. A Bhaal spawn without <PRO_HISHER> soul...~
@205  = ~Did he do it to weaken you, or to gain strength for himself?~
@206  = ~He wanted to strengthen himself.~
@207  = ~He wanted to weaken me, surely.~
@208  = ~Both, I guess. He seems to like experimenting. It's well possible he watches me in my struggle, enjoying the sight.~
@209  = ~Whatever, Solaufein. What is your point?~
@210  = ~Although I never would have imagined to live these times like I do now. No longer in the Underdark, but at the side of a Bhaal spawn the solar calls the chosen one...~
@211  = ~I know it was the search for a mighty foe that lead you to the Underdark, in search for your soul. A Bhaal spawn without a soul is a thought I'd imagined to be rather unettling. Instead, it was you who came.~
@212  = ~I won't give in to the heritage's evil influences, Solaufein.~
@213  = ~Oh, there have been... incidents rather unconvenient for bystanders, you know.~
@214  = ~What is your point?~
@215  = ~Since I will be affected by it, this information holds some value to me, you know!~
@216  = ~I have to admit I am confused. I would have wished for a less... notable companion for my escape to the surface.~
@217  = ~But I don't mean to sound ungrateful. If you wouldn't have been who you are, you wouldn't have come to Ust Natha. I wouldn't be here but still down there, trying to decide whether living is worth the pain.~
@218  = ~Let's go and regain your soul, then.~
@219  = ~Let's go and continue shaping your destiny, then.~
@220  = ~I am sure he achieved his goal - if he can handle the soul, that is.~
@221  = ~If he managed to do that I am impressed just how strong you have to be with your soul!~
@222  = ~Even better if he watches. Because then he would be closer by and easier for us to find!~
@223  = ~So, I am travelling under the command of a surfacer named <CHARNAME> now.~ [c#ablank]
@224  = ~Not long ago, my only reaction would have been unbelieving laughter if commanded to do so. Although we might cooperate with surfacers, we drow believe to be the only superior race. Having to obey the commands of a surfacer would have been an unspeakable degradation.~
@225  = ~To be commanded by a <PRO_RACE>... Never I would have imagined such. I still need to adjust to the thought.~
@226  = ~Is it that bad?~
@227  = ~Still, you yearned for being at the surface, didn't you?~
@228  = ~The difference is whether being ordered to do so, or having the free choice.~
@229  = ~Yes, sometimes life goes differently than imagined.~
@230  = ~You really should rid yourself from your drow attitude, Solaufein.~
@231  = ~Great we talked about it. Let's move on.~
@232  = ~Bad? No. But very different.~
@233  = ~Different to what you imagined, or differnt to what your life was before?~
@234  = ~I didn't imagine being here. Not as a real option. I didn't dare to.~
@235  = ~Yes, I did. But yearning is a mere feeling, with no specifics.~
@236  = ~Depending on situation and opportunities. I know, <CHARNAME>.~
@237  = ~It is different to everything I experienced before, <CHARNAME>. But... not necessarily to the worse. And it wasn't my intention to imply this, either.~
@238  = ~Don't forget that the superiority of the drow was taught to me for centuries. This is the measure I weighted my world against until not too long ago...~
@239  = ~This of course is past, of which I want to part fully. I only mentioned it because I can't stop pondering about my current situation, <CHARNAME>. Considering how impressive everything turns out to be, it is no wonder I can't stop my thoughts from racing!~
@240  = ~As you wish!~
@241  = ~That's a nice name for centuries of indoctrination, but yes, I am working on it.~
@242  = ~I still recall the drow you were in Ust Natha. Some part of you was preserved by the spell of the Silver Lady. But being a <PRO_RACE> lets you seem much more authentic, much more convincing.~ [c#ablank]
@243  = ~Weren't I tricked by your appearance, I would have noticed in Ust Natha the impossibility of you being an Underdark drow.~ [c#ablank]
@244  = ~You did very well, and yet your... being different was palpable.~
@245  = ~'Being different'?~
@246  = ~I take this as a compliment, Solaufein!~
@247  = ~I beg your pardon?~
@248  = ~(snort!) If you say so.~
@249  = ~What I meant was your surfacer way of behaving. You might act all tough and fierce, but compared to a drow you are quite... soft.~
@250  = ~Soft?~
@251  = ~Maybe I am.~
@252  = ~So, where's the problem?~
@253  = ~That sounded like an insult. This conversation ends here.~
@254  = ~Kind.~
@255  = ~Kind equals soft?~
@256  = ~Well, it's the surface now. Politeness is the key for social interactions, Solaufein.~
@257  = ~It was only a remark. I am not implying your fighting skills are low or that you wouldn't be able to lead. It's only that... I need to get used to the fact that here, this is the normal way of interaction.~
@258  = ~It is difficult for me to embrace your friendly manners. Sometimes I am overcome by the suspicion that you are only playing me... that you might let me fall and leave me to the mob, or maybe just dispose of me yourself.~
@259  = ~I wouldn't do that.~
@260  = ~Same here, I keep thinking whether you might drop your friendly facade and turn against me at some point, Solaufein.~
@261  = ~I would call that a healthy mistrust.~
@262  = ~Yes, it would be possible something like that happens. You are drow, after all.~
@263  = ~Where I come frome, politeness is a sign of missing assertiveness. For drow, kindness equals weakness, and weakness means death. It... is hard for me to detach from the feeling this is how it would be, even though my sense tells me otherwise.~
@264  = ~(snort!) You are far easier to irritate than I thought if you feel offense in such a remark!~
@265  = ~Healthy mistrust, indeed.~
@266  = ~That's what most would say, <CHARNAME>.~
@267  = ~Despite my inquietude I am deeply impressed by your friendly interactions, <CHARNAME>. It is so... much less strenuous not having to expect a knife in the back at every moment.~
@268  = ~The most I am impressed by the laughter of your surfacers. The joyous, lighthearted, with a playful sparkle in the eyes... All I knew was the taunting, the triumphant, the humiliating laugh.~
@269  = ~But no wonder the drow never learnt to laugh the way you surfacers do. There is no light down there that could shine into the eyes and reveal that friendly shine which makes all hearts leap up of all creatures able to feel even a little empathy.~
@270  = ~I can only shake my head at the thought of you bringing the downfall of a whole city, disguised as a drow. Another proof of the blindness of my race, being deceived so easily.~ [c#ablank]
@271  = ~What do you mean 'easily'? The magic of a Silver Dragon was behind this!~
@272  = ~It was chaotic times. I think some saw what they wanted to see.~
@273  = ~The way you say it it sounds deprecative.~
@274  = ~Let's end the conversation here.~
@275  = ~This is true. This power is unmatched. Adalon has guarded the exit to the surface for immemorial time, without us being able to defeat her.~
@276  = ~(sigh) But now she's dead. You've done what the Drows didn't achieve in centuries... I will not ponder for the reasons you did it. But we, too, were about to force the guardian of the exit to give up.~
@277  = ~I remember too well the recent events that led to the fall of an important House in Ust Natha... (One side of his mouth twitches grimly.)~
@278  = ~Even without my false dragon eggs you have found a way to cheat Phaere and Matron Mother Ardulace. Maybe your hiding game was already detected, I do not know. The important thing is that House Despana has fallen!~
@279  = ~Thanks to you. How much I would have liked to see Phaere's face!~
@280  = ~Why? Just because I said 'easily'?~
@281  = ~Yes, because of that. You used this word to make clear it wasn't my doing but only due to the 'blindness of your race'~
@282  = ~Hmph. Maybe I exaggerated a bit, but you have to see that the behavior of you surfacers is very different to the drows'. Looking back I am surprised we didn't see through your disguise sooner.~
@283  = ~<CHARNAME>, when you were turned into drow by Adalon's spell, did you talk the drow language like you do now your native tongue?~ [c#ablank]
@284  = ~Why are you asking?~
@285  = ~Yes, I did.~
@286  = ~The illusion went through and through. Even our own minds were fooled.~
@287  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Solaufein.~
@288  = ~Because I reminded myself that you were the drow being kind to me in the Underdark. I do recognize you, but you are a <PRO_RACE> now, and I am talking in your native tongue. In Ust Natha it was you speaking accent free drow language.~
@289  = ~For me, nothing changed about our conversations. I spoke drow without noticing.~
@290  = ~Is it usual for you to speak our tongue, as a drow?~
@291  = ~I do speak drow anyway, at least well enough.~
@292  = ~Solaufein, please spare me your *accent free* attention!~
@293  = ~Indeed? I am surprised to hear this. I guess I should ask you how it came to this and what your motivation was to learn it.~
@294  = ~But I feel like Drizzt, <CHARNAME>. Do not resent my notion, but I do not wish to hear this language any time soon.~
@295  = ~A pity. I would have liked practicing with you.~
@296  = ~I don't wish to talk about it, Solaufein.~
@297  = ~Maybe later, <CHARNAME>, when I'll be more accustomed to your way of living.~
@298  = ~Why don't you ask the priestess?~
@299  = ~Now we are talking yours, and I am glad to have learnt it so well.~
@300  = ~Yes. All drow are teached to speak it. And yet, my former matron would be surprised if hearing me talk like I do now. I am much more articualte and can express myself far more eloquently than my tuition would allow.~
@301  = ~Now I am curious. How did you learn to speak our language so well?~
@302  = ~Well... I used additional practice were I could get it, mostly with some of the slaves.~
@303  = ~I wanted to be able to speak your language perfectly. I told myself I would do it because of the advantages it would give me if confronted with surfacers...~
@304  = ~I think I never admitted it to myself and probably never would have, but the real reason was a yearning, a wanting... for your world.~
@305  = ~And now I am here, pronouncing words in this language I could only practice in secret for so long, and I feel... joy!~
@306  = ~I don't know what is the matter with me, I barely recognize myself. I am saying things to you I never would have in my own tonue. Things that are on my mind...~
@307  = ~(snort!) Even now, in this very moment!...~
@308  = ~Let us move on.~
@309  = ~Attention? I thought I am conversing in a normal manner... But as you wish, I will stop telling my mind like a fool!~
@310  = ~I didn't mean it like that. I just don't want to talk right now.~
@311  = ~What a wonderful idea. Please stick to it in the future!~
@312  = ~Hmph. These weapons are nothing compared to what the drow smiths are making.~ [c#ablank]
@313  = ~I had some weapons from the surface back in the Underdark, but I never really used them. They didn't compare with the ones we used normally.~
@314  = ~I am sorry that our weapons displease you.~
@315  = ~I beg your pardon? Our weapons are by no means that bad.~
@316  = ~Don't be silly. Our weapons might be forged differently, but they aren't poorer than drow weapons.~
@317  = ~How about: 'A weapon is as good as the one wielding it', hm?~
@318  = ~Except for the tiny little fact that they'll all turn to dust if exposed to the sun?~
@319  = ~Drow, keep your mouth and spare me your whining in the future!~
@320  = ~Forgive me. You equipped me with weapons and armor, and I should be thankful for it.~
@321  = ~That was a matter of course.~
@322  = ~In return you are fighting for me.~
@323  = ~You are handling them well, Solaufein. Your fighting prowess is great.~
@324  = ~It's weapons I have no other use for, Solaufein.~
@325  = ~Hmph. Are you trying to make fun of me?~
@326  = ~(snort!) Well, weapons do increase my fighting prowess significantly.~
@327  = ~You are admitting it?~
@328  = ~Pah! I'm lamenting like an old male. We lingered long enough.~
@329  = ~I... I spoke ill of our weapons recently. I know it is not my place to do so. And that it is foolish considering what would happen with my high regarded drow weapons if exposed to the light!~ [c#ablank]
@330  = ~Thank you for admitting this, Solaufein.~
@331  = ~You would fare well with a little less arrogance, you know.~
@332  = ~Just stop whining, and everything will be fine.~
@333  = ~Even I am able to realize when I'm making a fool of myself.~
@334  = ~You are right to scold me. I am... lamenting about things that are unchangeable and which I chose myself.~
@335  = ~Also, it isn't... true that I would despise them so much. On the contrary. Maybe they aren't as mighty as some I wielded in the Underdark, but they *are* made of durable material.~
@336  = ~It is the reason surfacer items always fascinated me - they seamed to be different. More blunt... and yet more real. Even the writing, on paper made to endure sunlight.~
@337  = ~You mentioned writing? Did you have some from the surface?~
@338  = ~Where from did you get your surfacer items?~
@339  = ~Aha. Let us move on.~
@340  = ~Yes. Drow attach importance to the education of their young. We were teached everything that would increase our capability to act. I wasn't only teached your tongue, but also your lettering.~
@341  = ~There are merchants coming into the Underdark. But mostly... the items were not given to me, <CHARNAME>. I paid them with blood.~
@342  = ~Mostly, they originated from raids from the surface I did as a young male. Later, I didn't need them to impress my matron, but I went nontheless. It was the only possibility to get to the surface and... receive information.~
@343  = ~Tell me about these raids, Solaufein. I always thought their only reason would be to bring chaos and destruction to the surface.~
@344  = ~*You* participated on raids to the surface?! Innocent people were murdered!~
@345  = ~Well, that is what the surfacers see, and it's indeed intended. One important reason young males go on raids to the surface is to impress their matron, however. Going there is very dangerous for us drow. Anyone managing to come back with a... trophy proves his courage and fighting prowess.~
@346  = ~What kind of 'trophy' are we talking here?~
@347  = ~The actual trophies were... surfacer heads, other proof of their deaths, or alive ones for the slave pits - for the honor of Lolth~
@348  = ~Did you bring... 'trophies' yourself, too?~
@349  = ~You are different than other drow, Solaufein.~
@350  = ~Of course I have!~
@351  = ~What do you expect? I am drow! Do you think my weapons were never soaked in surfacer blood?! <PRO_RACE> or other surfacer races, it didn't matter. Wasn't this plain to you when you allowed me into your group? How do you think I was raised by my people?!~
@352  = ~It would be foolish of you to forget about this. Better keep it in mind, and reevaluate whether you want me around!~
@353  = ~I swore myself never to be so uncautious as I was there at the entrance of the silver dragon's lair. Imrae got me even though I was vigilant... I was supposed to become a drider! Only thanks to you I am here now, unscarthed.~ [c#ablank]
@354  = ~I see why this would be frustrating.~
@355  = ~You will be better prepared next time.~
@356  = ~It all went well, though.~
@357  = ~You should watch out something like this never happens again. It would endanger not only you but us all.~
@358  = ~Ha! Better prepared? Where, here?!~
@359  = ~Went well?! Having to cut me out of a drider cocoon you would call 'went well'?~
@360  = ~You did not understand what I was saying. I swore to myself never to be so unprepared - and now I am here.~
@361  = ~Would a handmaiden of Lolth caught up with me *here*, she still empowered with the magic from the Underdark whereas I so weakened - I wouldn't have the slightest chance!~
@362  = ~If you expect me to fight with high prowess, then it was a mistake to bring me here to the surface. I am a drow, trained for the most enduring of fights. But here, my strength is drained by the sun every day more!~
@363  = ~I draw peace from the knowledge that the handmaidens have more important things to do than to hunt for renegates - if they emerge to the surface at all.~
@364  = ~(snort!) Well, for that they have their little helpers, the servants of the drider queen...~
@365  = ~I did not exaggerate when saying that the sun takes the strength out of me, <CHARNAME>. I am able to wield a weapon, and sometimes even manage to hit a foe, if he is standing near anough...~ [c#ablank]
@366  = ~But my magic seems to have vanished. What is left is a meager resemblance of the magic I was able to wield in the Underdark. So... it is indeed true...~
@367  = ~What do you mean by 'it is true'?~
@368  = ~Would it help if we returned to the Underdark for a while?~
@369  = ~Seems the drow magic is connected to the Underdark.~
@370  = ~You said this already recently. Did it get worse?~
@371  = ~Don't bother. I need you as a fighter, nothing more.~
@372  = ~From childhood on the handmaidens tell us that we drow are only strong in the Underdark, in the spider queen's realm. I never doubted that we would be more exposed and therefore more threatened at the surface, but just how much drow are weakened, I completely underestimated.~
@373  = ~I do not know what gives me more unease: That my magic diminshed as much as it did... or that I have to agree to what *handmaidens* proclaimed.~
@374  = ~You'll be fine.~
@375  = ~Many a drow might have returned remorsefully to the spider queen's realm after experiencing this weakness on the surface. Many a renegate might have doubted Eilistraee's words in the blinding light and hotness of the sun...~
@376  = ~I... I mean to be strong. Nothing bothers me more than Drizzt's words that the sun would not be my foe. I don't understand them!~
@377  = ~I'm not telling you merely to lament about my fate, <CHARNAME>. My words heed a warning as well. No longer I am one of the strong drow you know from the Underdark. I might be a capable fighter, still... Yes, as a fighter and mule I might still serve well.~
@378  = ~By Eilistraee! You want to lead me back into the Unterdark while I try to leave the spider queen's realm behind me? No, if it is the gods' will then I will be weak, here at the surface!~
@379  = ~And even if, I doubt you would want to wait the time it would take my magic to recover. I, at least, would have no wish to remain that long!~
@380  = ~Indeed. Our whole existence is because we gave ourselves to the spider queen in the deep darkness. It is only of consequent that we would lose most of it if returning to the surface.~
@381  = ~No... But it didn't improve, either.~
@382  = ~(snort!) I can only as much as guess why you would have me come with you, <CHARNAME>. Are you content with what I became?~ [c#ablank]
@383  = ~What do you mean?~
@384  = ~Yes, I am.~
@385  = ~No, I'm not.~
@386  = ~I'm having you with me because I think you are worth it.~
@387  = ~I lost my magic, I am blind for most of the day, my concentration is strained by all the unused sounds and sights around us, I still am not entirely firm with my new weapons, and my appearance raises hostility wherever we go.~
@388  = ~I am sorry you are feeling so insecure and unsafe, Solaufein.~
@389  = ~That's a fitting list.~
@390  = ~Good graceous, calm down!~
@391  = ~You think so?!~
@392  = ~I am not surprised!~
@393  = ~There are only two possibilies I can think of why you would do such a thing. The first is that you welcome my weakness and rejoice about the tamed monster at your side.~
@394  = ~Or maybe you are more naive and kind hearted than I imagined possible, and might even feel responsible for my well being!~
@395  = ~Hmph. The way I see you behave I fear it is the latter. You seem to believe you can overcome your foes with kindness. I guess I am the best example that you succeed, indeed!~
@396  = ~Not your empathy on top of it all!~
@397  = ~Isn't it?!~
@398  = ~<CHARNAME>, I regret the words I spoke to you, they put me in shame. I *am* thankful to you for rescuing me and taking me into your group. Your ways of living and interacting is... unfamiliar, but not unpleasant. I spoke in anger.~ [c#ablank]
@399  = ~Then tell me what angered you so, Solaufein.~
@400  = ~You owe me an explanation, I would say.~
@401  = ~I don't care, Solaufein. Best you stop confiding in me altogether, then I won't have to listen to any of your insults again.~
@402  = ~Perhaps you can relate, <CHARNAME>. My senses are very dulled, still. They don't recover as fast as I thought... as fast as I had hoped - in my naivite...~
@403  = ~And that is why you are angry?~
@404  = ~I can relate to your frustration.~
@405  = ~You are a lot of things, but naive isn't one of them, Solaufein.~
@406  = ~Naive, indeed.~
@407  = ~It seems I tend to hope against all odds... Only weeks ago I would have called myself completely naive for my dream of leaving the Underdark forever.~
@408  = ~I am angry about my shortcomings... and my impatience because of it.~
@409  = ~I am drow. Only recently, I was part of a society of merciless hirarchy, with punishments as frequently as well deadly.~
@410  = ~But I am here now, and my refelexes are becoming slower, my senses aren't that sharp any more, my eyes still blinded by the sunlight. I feel myself weaken and becoming an easy target, my fighting prowess dwindling. This is not good!~
@411  = ~I can't agree to that description. You are fighting well.~
@412  = ~That is exactly why we all combined forces. So we can have each other's backs!~
@413  = ~Well now. If it is as you say, then it would be alarming, indeed.~
@414  = ~You should focus on keeping your fighting prowess up, or I won't have much use of you any more.~
@415  = ~I still demand you to keep your anger at bay. It's the least I can expect!~
@416  = ~I am! Be assured, that is what I am doing.~
@417  = ~(snort!) I'm lamenting like an old male. I should keep my mouth shut, least you decide to get rid of me like the drow do with their old and useless males!~
@418  = ~I guess it will take a while until my mind will be at ease up here... if it ever was. Until then, I fear you will have to bear with my temper.~
@419  = ~It doesn't change the fact that my fighting prowess is diminished compared to what it once was... And that getting *better* should be the aim here.~
@420  = ~Indeed, and I appreciate your support.~
@421  = ~You mean my current behavior contradicts to how I was raised to behave as a drow male? Yes, I guess you are right. But the whole situation of my current life contradicts the way I lived before!~
@422  = ~We are travelling as companions for a while now, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@423  = ~I appreciate how you treat those that seek our help along the way.~
@424  = ~And also, the interest you show in me during or should I better say despite my constant lamenting flatters me endlessly. I have to say it: Your actions are an ideal I enjoy taking examples of.~
@425  = ~(snort!) So, and now it's your turn to tell me that you never intended to take such a weakling into your group and that I am no longer the drow you met in Ust Natha. And you would be right, but I... I am strangely content about it.~
@426  = ~That you have no interest in me sharing my constant lamenting with you is very understandable. It is unfortunate, of course, from my perspective. But I can't blame you for it. I will take example of how you treat others, though.~
@427  = ~No, you got that wrong. I am interested in you indeed, but not always there is time to share a lengthy conversation.~
@428  = ~Do what you want, and do it quietly. I didn't take you along for talking.~
@429  = ~Indeed? If this is the case, then I am content.~
@430  = ~I got that, <CHARNAME>.~
@431  = ~You are friendly to me, but the way you act towards other does not always show this charitableness. You are indeed interested in your own profit if dealing with others. I have to assume that this is the reason you are friendly to me, as well.~
@432  = ~No, Solaufein. I truly like you.~
@433  = ~My experince taught me to judge others by their deeds, not their words, <CHARNAME>. Converse with me whenever you want. But I will not take example of the way you treat others seeking our help.~
@434  = ~Well, there is no use talking around it. Your behavior towards others makes it very clear it is your own advantage you seek.~
@435  = ~Also, you did not show any interest for my concerns. Not that I could blame you for that, though.~
@436  = ~But just as much I do not see a reason to feel overly attached to you. I will stay in your group, however, as long as you find me useful. What comes after, we will have to see.~
@437  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm not sure... (growls).~ [c#sola10] 
@438  = ~What?~
@439  = ~I something wrong?~
@440  = ~I don't want to hear any more from you, Solaufein. Get back in line and be quiet!~
@441  = ~You mean I won't have to deal with your perpetual friendlyness any more? That is... good.~
@442  = ~Definitely.~
@443  = ~I was turning my back to you. Did you notice?~
@444  = ~Er, no?~
@445  = ~Yes, I did.~
@446  = ~What of it?~
@447  = ~I didn't notice right away. You were behins my back, and I couldn't see you at all times!~
@448  = ~So?~
@449  = ~Do you have to see me at all times?~
@450  = ~What is your point? Make it quick.~
@451  = ~Not if you are away far enough. Don't you see what I mean?~
@452  = ~It is exactly what we talked about only recently! I didn't keep an eye on you... Only for a small instant, but it would have sufficed for you to use the moment and kill me, and it was I who gave you the opportunity! I'm growing weak! I'm losing my vigilance, my fighting power, everything that once defined me!~
@453  = ~No, spare your words. Do not comment on this! Neither do I wish to be rebuked by you nor get one of your unbelievable comforting comments of understanding!~
@454  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>. Do you wish to know why I was so short with you as of late?~ [c#ablank]
@455  = ~Yes, please tell me what is bothering you.~
@456  = ~Is this the beginning of an apology?~
@457  = ~No, not really, to be honest.~
@458  = ~You want me to keep quiet, then? That we stop sharing our thoughts?~
@459  = ~No, please speak, if it is important to you.~
@460  = ~Yes, please! You are fighting alongside me, and that's it. I am not interested in your 'conversations'.~
@461  = ~That... it might very well be.~
@462  = ~That I would turn my back to you - unconsciously, do you understand why it scared me so much?~
@463  = ~Because you fear that your vigilance is diminished?~
@464  = ~Because you don't trust me?~
@465  = ~No, I don't know.~
@466  = ~It is no surprise you would suspect this to be the cause, as frequently as I spoke about it.~
@467  = ~Ha! If only...~
@468  = ~I was concerned my reduced vigilance would decrease my chances of survival - although no longer being between drow, but here with you.~
@469  = ~But it is not only my diminished prowess that concerns me. It is also my... feelings.~
@470  = ~Your way of living, of treating one another - the friendly words and geastures, the trust you grant each other... At the beginning, I was thrilled. It filled me like a rush, it felt like being on a surge of excitement. I was willing to endure the disadvantages the sun and being away from the Underdark bestowed on me. I knew I had to pay a price, and expected to adjust to it after some time.~
@471  = ~Well my weakness consists, as you well know. But... this alone wouldn't be such a problem, had I not the impression that I would *actively* work on intensifying them!~
@472  = ~I notice myself participating in your friendly ways. I am... relaxing - even though my physical restrictions still persist, my mind seems to come to ease, as absurd as this sounds. My vigilance is lacking. I am turning myself into easy prey if I don't watch out!~
@473  = ~My harsh words resulted from a sudden feeling of... uncertainty. I felt like being knocked off my feet. To be here is far more overwhelming than I would have ever expected, <CHARNAME>.~
@474  = ~You are starting to trust in others, Solaufein.~
@475  = ~You are not alone. We'll have your back.~
@476  = ~You said several times that you do enjoy the friendly ways and are glad not to have to watch your back all the time. And now all of a sudden it would be too much?~
@477  = ~Is lamenting all you are capable of?~
@478  = ~Is it not understandable that there can be a great difference between an idea and actually living it? I have to surpress many of my instincts to be so close to you. The other half of my vigilance is occupied with the restrictions due to the sun. It is exhausting!~
@479  = ~Trust? Drizzt mentioned trust... as a base for friendship.~
@480  = ~Everything that is happening currently feels like the weakening of my self. If this is the prerequisit for living between you surfacers, then it is a bad thing! Do I have to lose trust into my own abilities before being able to learn the friendly way of interacting? What sense would that make?~
@481  = ~You will understand once you are ready to trust in others.~
@482  = ~A lot, Solaufein. Trusting others means putting part of your wellbeing into their hands.~
@483  = ~None, but that's how it is.~
@484  = ~We talked long enough about your feelings.~
@485  = ~Well, I *had* that in the past, and I didn't like it at all!~
@486  = ~I expected difficulties to give in to trust. I was not, however, prepared that it would feel as if I'd have to give up every bit of my self-understanding.~
@487  = ~It shouldn't surprise you. You are working against being conditioned to mistrust for centuries.~
@488  = ~That's not what it takes. You'll have to change your self-understanding, is all.~
@489  = ~I expect not to let go of my last bit of self respect and vigilance just because being overwhelmed like a toddler!~
@490  = ~I told you, because you are my leader and should know how I am.~
@491  = ~Also, you *are* my mentor for living at the surface... Whether you like it, or not.~
@492  = ~Is all? You speak of great achievements with great confidence. There is no magic of a wyrm backing up my attempt of assimilation, <CHARNAME>!~
@493  = ~I... had an inner struggle these past time, <CHARNAME>. I thought I could ignore and wait for my peoccupation to pass, but my recent behavior makes it very clear that this is no option.~ [c#ablank]
@494  = ~Do you have an idea what I considered last night? I pondered about which of my abilities is still at full strength. One discipline which does not suffer from my diminished prowess. Where my century long drill would pay off because I could still impress you, despite my pathetic condition.~
@495  = ~I searched for the one thing I would be better trained at and could better perform than any surfacer. And the only thing coming to my mind, the only thing I think would fit this description, is the lust services we males are trained at beginning from childhood so we are able to satisfy our matron mothers. The lust services!~
@496  = ~I distaste nothig more than these! But I seriously did consider offering them to you - so you'd have to agree that I am better than any of your lovers... better than you. So you would have to pay respect to my skilled performance...~
@497  = ~This was the moment I realized I have to open up and tell you how I feel, or I will lose my mind. Will you listen?~
@498  = ~...Lust services?~
@499  = ~You do not have to prove anything to me!~
@500  = ~Of course, Solaufein, speak!~
@501  = ~No, I do not care about your problems. Be quiet and stop annoying me with them.~
@502  = ~Yes, lust services, but that is not what I wanted to talk to you about. Please, will you let me speak?~
@503  = ~Of course, Solaufein, speak!~
@504  = ~Only, if you tell me about your idea concerning the lust services again, Solaufein.~
@505  = ~Not to you - it was me I needed to prove something. I need your... guidance.~
@506  = ~Young <PRO_RACE>, I do not seek your physical intimacy. It does not mean to me what it seems to mean to you surfacers. It is a connection... of minds I am looking for.~
@507  = ~I spoke recently and told you about my difficulty to give in to trust...~
@508  = ~Denying doesn't work. Trying to either keeping my mind from it or ridiculing it only increased my confusion. Because the strongest feeling filling me, shaking my drow self to the grounds of its very being, is the connection, the closeness I feel towards you, <CHARNAME>.~
@509  = ~Do you hear me, strong <PRO_RACE>? Never I have spoken like this to anyone.~
@510  = ~Connection? What exactly do you mean with that?~
@511  = ~Is this a love confession?~
@512  = ~Then maybe you shouldn't start talking like this now.~
@513  = ~I do not wish to hear any more, Solaufein. Get back in line.~
@514  = ~Love? For your surfacers, this term includes physical closeness if used for non-related adults. Do you know how old I am? How young you are in comparison? No, this is not what I am looking for.~
@515  = ~I feel safe in your presence. Safe, and... comfortable. I do not startle if you take steps towards me. I turn my back towards you - without even noticing.~
@516  = ~I feel a strange urge for you to acknowledge my feelings. Not because I expect advantages for myself from it, but because I want you to feel in a similar way towards me.~
@517  = ~Why am I putting myself into such dependence from you if all I aim for is independence and being able to prevail on my own? Does it make any sense?~
@518  = ~You are seeking friendship. This is what you are feeling.~
@519  = ~Solaufein, it was a love declaration. Admit it!~
@520  = ~I hear you babbling, weakling, and I am appalled. I might have enjoyed you as a lover, but this I have no use for. Get a grib on yourself!~
@521  = ~I have difficulties to apprehend your definition of love, <CHARNAME>. It includes physical aspects I woud never combine with it myself. It claimes the other person to oneself in a possessive way that I don't wish for myself. No, it was no love declaration as you see it.~
@522  = ~Is there no chance at all to win your heart?~
@523  = ~Of all things! I can't believe how you can open your heart to me the way you did and then shy away from the last, logical step. Keep your thoughts to yourself from now on!~
@524  = ~Friendship... Yes, I think you are right. It is a mental kind of connection I am yearning for. Like a gawping child I take in everything I see from this life while in your presence... What a fool I am!~
@525  = ~Why do you call yourself a fool?~
@526  = ~You are not a fool, Solaufein! I would be happy to call you my friend.~
@527  = ~If feel like a fool, maybe you should keep your mouth shut in the future!~
@528  = ~But you have it already! You have it right in your hands. I opened my heart to you like I never did before to anyone. Only what you call love - boundless devotion, physical commitment - this I cannot give you!~
@529  = ~Hrmph. Not even the cruel handmaidens had the power to shut me up just like that.~
@530  = ~I had hoped differently, but if this is what you wish, then so shall it be.~
@531  = ~But I will show you my respect and be quiet from now on, as you wish.~
@532  = ~Is this true? Then... then I will be your friend. I am proud a surfacer calls me so.~
@533  = ~I am drow... what else than a fool am I if thinking that I could have friends?~
@534  = ~I was quite harsh in some of our earlier conversations. Knowing you are calling yourself my friend, I feel ashamed when thinking about it.~ [c#ablank]
@535  = ~(snort!) I can call myself lucky you took to me the way you did, it seems...~
@536  = ~But still I have difficulties to understand what is going on. My behavior is that of an old male with nothing to lose, musing about life, chatting with you pleasantly... I am drow, and as weak as I am currently, my people would have killed me long before!~
@537  = ~In the world I know it would be a big mistake to tell you as much as I did about myself. To give away one's private thoughts is equal to let your flank unprotected in a fight - it weakens oneself and gives the opponent the possibility to cause much damage! How can I be sure you won't use it against me someday?~
@538  = ~You really think I would take advantage of you in this way? I am not like that!~
@539  = ~You need to trust me, Solaufein. That's how friendship works.~
@540  = ~And even if - are you that weak that you need to be afraid of it?~
@541  = ~Solaufein! Please spare me this whining.~
@542  = ~You are right, I am whining. You are a strong <PRO_RACE>, <CHARNAME>. Forgive me my weakness, I won't lose control again.~
@543  = ~I didn't imply that I expect you to take advantage. I am trying to accustome myself to your way of living, but it is not that easy! I feel torn apart between the feeling of friendship I so desperately want to give in to, and the pure mistrust which secured my survival the past centuries.~
@544  = ~But you... you are *chatting* with me as if I wouldn't mean any danger to you! How can you be sure that *I* will not betray *you* one day, <CHARNAME>?~
@545  = ~I don't, but I trust you.~
@546  = ~In case this happens I will be prepared!~
@547  = ~We will see how things go, Solaufein. Everyone's behavior is also dependent on the circumstances. Sometimes, even friends betray each other.~
@548  = ~I have no intention of betraying you, <CHARNAME>. But I am drow, so your take on it is justified. I am only trying to make it clear that you *should* not trst me. One can never know which foolishness you credulous surfacers are up to next!~
@549  = ~But I do trust you, Solaufein! It's how friendship works.~
@550  = ~How lucky I am to have you foresightful drow with me then, eh?~
@551  = ~I see that you are serious about it although I do not understand why. Why do you trust me, the drow? Did you not listen to what I said? Did you not witness how we drow deal with trust? Trusting me still you seem to be more naive than I thought!~
@552  = ~What has it to do with you how 'the drow' are doing things?~
@553  = ~I saw how *you* are dealing with trust, and that is what matters.~
@554  = ~Well... I see what you mean.~
@555  = ~Your cordiality remains unchanged.~
@556  = ~Not long ago I would have spat in front of your feet. But now I am most grateful for your friendly words.~
@557  = ~It is... a complete new experience to be surrounded by friendly faces, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@558  = ~There weren't that many in In Ust Natha, I take it?~
@559  = ~It must be horrible.~
@560  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Solaufein.~
@561  = ~Horrible? Although I think that I understand what you are aiming at I still would rather call the time I left behind 'horrible'.~
@562  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, none. Well, there was one, once... But it vanished a long time ago.~
@563  = ~...Phaere?~
@564  = ~Do you want to talk about it?~
@565  = ~Yes - Phaere.~
@566  = ~I mentioned recently how your surfacer's laughing surprised and still fascinates me. I am referring to the one I never heard from my kind, the friendly, jolly one...~
@567  = ~With Phaere I almost would have laughed like that. Almost...~
@568  = ~But that is a story that is long over and in the past.~
@569  = ~Tell me about you and Phaere.~
@570  = ~I don't want to hear old stories.~
@571  = ~I told you Phaere and I were in love once. Well, do not mistake the term for what you surfcers mean by it.~
@572  = ~That I, the male, had to be of service to her, the oldest daughter of the house Despana, was self-evident. No, our love manifested itself in her protecting me from most of the cruelest reprisals... and that I could talk to her without having to weigh every word, without having to fear to be punished for every careless remark. It was a situation unthinkable for a drow male.~
@573  = ~Some of the indications you just mentioned are rather unsettling.~
@574  = ~Sounds like an exciting relationship.~
@575  = ~Please, go on.~
@576  = ~Solaufein, I do not wish to hear the details.~
@577  = ~Do you think so? And yet I am telling about something wonderful, <CHARNAME>.~
@578  = ~She could trust me. Never I would have harmed her in any way...~
@579  = ~...Upon returning from the hand maidens' punishment, her behavior towards me was cruel even for drow standarts. My house had to step in... We became prisoners in this destructive impasse. The protection of my house, keeping me safe from lethal cruelty, was at the same time the curse that binded me to my services to the house Despana.~
@580  = ~As the male who I am I could be glad for this outcome, as I came out of it without further... consequences. I closed myself to her reprisals, carried out her orders and concentrated on my status as a male warrior. But that was at the outside. On the inside... I found to my Lady Eilistraee and do believe like her that my race strayed from the right path.~
@581  = ~Do you want to hear the whole story?~
@582  = ~Are you kidding? That's what I was waiting for the whole time!~
@583  = ~I thought this was the long version, but yes, go ahaed.~
@584  = ~I was her favorite male. Maybe the traces of opportunism I showed even then pleased her. I still believed myself to be a child of the spider queen then, but I lacked the will to play the game of intrigue to gain small advantages. I think she noticed this and liked it, back then.~
@585  = ~She kept me close by, and our contact was... friendlier than common. I was a strong male, protected by an influencial house. A good choice, so to say. We spent time together, just we two. We liked being with each other. It was, for drow, a very uncommon and dangerous exclusivity...~
@586  = ~The seclusiveness of our relation did not go unnoticed. House Despana decided it went far beyond what was appropriate for drow. But they could not punish me, my house did not withdraw my protection - nothing inappropriate had happened but Matron Mother Ardulace being worried about the authority and leadership abilities of her eldest daughter. And so she sent the Maiden's to Phaere.~
@587  = ~They rid her of any feelings of goodwill towards me. Phaere understood perfectly well why she got punished so cruelly, and had no restraint to let me feel it afterwards. Oh, how much she yearned for the possibility to take her revenge out on me in a final way! But my status as a male was too high and my house was too powerful, so we were both damned to live on.~
@588  = ~I gained the status as a leader in the male fighting guild not much later, after putting all my efforts into my training and my services to Lolth out of mere lack of alternatives. You might have called it devastation. Back then, all I knew is that I lost the huge advantage of having the favor of a first daughter of a powerful house - and that life would be much more difficult.~
@589  = ~It was much later before I faced the fact that it was more that got lost.. For me, and I do not know but I assume for Phaere, too. I concentrated on her as a partner in a way it is unfeasible for a drow. We male live to serve the higher ranked female... Many of my brethren would do anything to impress and be noticed by one of the higher daughters and maton mothers, but to favor one of them? To enjoy being near her, without aim or reason?... Unthinkable.~
@590  = ~My life got much more complicated after that. I was disappointed and disillusioned, and still alive out of mere luck. She who meant so much to me before was now my sworn enemy. It was but a matter of time until I realized my internal conflict and ambivalence and turned towards my Lady Eilistraee with the silver hair.~
@591  = ~It was in this time that I lead an ambush to the surface. I remember very well how I stood there, looking at the light that foretold the sunrise, and how I considered to run - run into the wrong direction, towards the rising sun...~
@592  = ~But I did not do that. I settled myself into my new life, functioning as a minion to the power seeking females, staying away from everything that was not crucial to secure my position.~
@593  = ~I'm glad you did! Otherwise, you wouldn't have been in Ust Natha still when I went there.~
@594  = ~I... was embittered and weary of my own life. I distasted the drow... For the evil deeds they do. For the evil deeds I did.~
@595  = ~I almost longed for you to kill me. But while still talking to you in the male fighter's guild I felt something sparking inside of me, touching my soul, filling me with a tremor of anticipation. Until then I was convinced I had no other choice but to accept my fate. In that moment, though, I realized that there is another way.~
@596  = ~You opened a window in my heart, <CHARNAME>. It surprises me how strong the feelings are coming through it - and also, that I... am talking to you about them.~
@597  = ~And now I am here with you. I thank the Lady with the Silver Hair that it came to be like this. And I thank you, <CHARNAME>, for being able to make first experiences as a... 'surfacer' under your protection.~
@598  = ~This is the whole story. I thank you for your patience. It felt good, telling it all for once.~
@599  = ~Im letzten Kampf konnte ich Euch wieder betrachten. Ihr kmpft sehr gut, <CHARNAME>. Ihr beherrscht Eure Profession.~ [c#ablank]
@600  = ~Thank you, Solaufein.~
@601  = ~Hat sich also Euer Eindruck von den "Schwchlingen", um die Ihr Euch auch noch kmmern musstet, nicht besttigt, ja?~
@602  = ~Ich mag diese Komplimente nicht, Solaufein. Ich wei selbst, dass ich gut bin, das habe ich hufig genug bewiesen.~
@603  = ~Es ist ungewohnt fr mich, so zu sprechen.~
@604  = ~Fr einen Drow ist das Beschimpfen anderer der normale Umgangston. Ich denke mit... leichtem Schaudern daran zurck, wie ich Euch in Ust Natha "begrt" habe.~
@605  = ~Why?~
@606  = ~Haha, ja, die Begrung war gut. Hat mir gleich den Kopf gewaschen bezglich der blichen Umgangsformen.~
@607  = ~Empfindet Ihr Euren Sprachstil jetzt als anders?~
@608  = ~Lasst uns weiterziehen.~
@609  = ~Dabei habt Ihr einige Verhaltensweisen gezeigt, die Euch htten verraten knnen.~
@610  = ~Ihr habt recht, mich zurechtzuweisen. Ich bin mit Eurer Art der Konversation nicht vertraut.~
@611  = ~Hat Euch das beleidigt?~
@612  = ~Sptestens zu dem Zeitpunkt, als Ihr mein Leben verschont habt. Aber auch vorher schon.~
@613  = ~Als Ihr Euch dafr entschuldigt habt, dass ich Euretwegen bestraft wurde. Das war eine sehr Drow-untypische Handlung! Im ersten Moment frchtete ich, Ihr wret zu weich fr das, was auf uns wartete. Doch dann hatte ich pltzlich noch ein anderes Gefhl... Eure Worte rhrten mich seltsam an. Ich habe Euch in diesem Augenblick mit anderen Augen betrachtet, <CHARNAME>.~
@614  = ~Etwas an Euch war anders. Ihr habt nicht... gekuscht, wenn Phaere Euch gescheucht hat. Als httet Ihr noch einen Trumpf zum Ausspielen. Als httet Ihr andere Mglichkeiten.~
@615  = ~Aber es erweckte in mir keinen Verdacht. Ich hatte das Gefhl, einen Gleichgesinnten zu treffen. Doch die Pflicht rief, und es war keine Zeit, auf Gefhle einzugehen... Und als Phaere uns dann wieder gegenberstand - (seufz) Da war das Gefhl vergessen. Diese Hexe! Es macht mich traurig, daran zu denken, dass sie einst anders war, dass ich einst in ihrer Gegenwart auch dieses Gefhl hatte. Und noch immer schaudere ich, wenn ich daran denke, was die Zofen Lolths ihr angetan haben, um dies zu zerstren...~
@616  = ~Aber Phaere hat mir in den Jahrzehnten danach genug Gelegenheit gegeben, sie zu verabscheuen. Pah! Es ist miges Geschwtz, was ich da von mir gebe. Lasst uns nicht weiter darber reden. Lasst mich nur sagen, dass sich meine Meinung ber Euch stark verndert hat, <CHARNAME>. In... jedem Sinne.~
@617  = ~Jetzt hier mit Euch zu reisen, berwltigt mich, <CHARNAME>. Und ich... registriere jede Eurer freundlichen Gesten, die in Eurem normalen Miteinander so hufig fallen. Ich erscheine daneben wohl oft verschlossen und unwirsch.~
@618  = ~Weil es mir nun so unverhltnismig verachtend vorkommt. Ich mchte nicht mehr so sprechen. Nicht, wenn ich mein Gegenber gar nicht kenne. Oder gar kenne und schtze.~
@619  = ~Und ob! Oder wann habe ich Euch denn das letzte mal einen Dummkopf genannt, Ihr Dummkopf?~
@620  = ~Wobei ich zugeben muss, bewusst unfreundliche Worte gewhlt zu haben. Ich hatte bereits lngere Zeit auf diese Gruppe aus Ched Nassad gewartet, das Zeitfenster zu Phaeres Befreiung wurde immer enger, und als Ihr endlich kamt... wirktet Ihr auf mich wie ein Haufen Kinder, deren Rstungen zu gro sind.~
@621  = ~Im Nachhinein denke ich, dass ich nur Eure Unsicherheit falsch interpretiert hatte, denn Eure hervorragende Kampfkraft konnte ich bald erleben. Aber als Ihr vor mir standet, sah ich in Euch nur ein Haufen junger unerfahrener Drow, die ihr Geschick im Kampf erproben wollten und ihr Leben fr eine selbstgerechte Aufgabe einer Mutter Oberin oder Zofe Lolths lassen wrden...~
@622  = ~Da mein Wohlergehen mit der erfolgreichen Erfllung der Aufgabe gekoppelt war, hoffte ich einfach, dass Ihr gut kmpfen konntet. Mehr habe ich zunchst nicht in Euch gesehen.~
@623  = ~Wieso auch, Ihr kanntet mich ja nicht.~
@624  = ~Der Eindruck hat sich wohl gendert?~
@625  = ~Das war wohl auch gut so. Dadurch hat unsere Maskerade lnger gehalten.~
@626  = ~Ich mchte das jetzt nicht so ausfhrlich hren, Solaufein.~
@627  = ~Ich htte es aber auch nicht fr mglich gehalten, zu was sich unsere Bekanntschaft entwickelt hat, htte es mir jemand gesagt.~
@628  = ~Was ich letzthin zu Euch sagte, sollte kein plumpes Kompliment sein, <CHARNAME>. Anbiederndes Gerede ist mir fremd. Ich kann Euren Kampfstil wirklich nur bewundern. Ihr msst wissen, dass Ihr Oberweltler fr uns Drow im ersten Moment immer verweichlicht erscheint...~ [c#ablank]
@629  = ~Das liegt an den freundlichen Umgangsformen, die Ihr miteinander pflegt. Ein Drow mit diesen Manieren wrde keinen Tag berleben.~
@630  = ~Sowas in der Art habt Ihr bereits gesagt.~
@631  = ~Das Reisen mit uns ist eine groe Herausforderung fr Euch, Solaufein.~
@632  = ~Wirklich nicht? Gegenber Eurer Mutter Oberin msst Ihr doch auch freundlich sein, oder nicht?~
@633  = ~Das kann schon sein. Lasst uns weitermachen.~
@634  = ~Nicht so. Hflich, unterwrfig, das ja. Aber nicht freundlich. Nicht in dem Sinne, wie ich es meinte. Freundlichkeit ist bei den Drow eine Schwche. Ich sehe erst langsam, dass sie es nicht ist.~
@635  = ~Das stimmt.~
@636  = ~Das stimmt! Habt Ihr das etwa jetzt gerade geschlussfolgert, oder habt Ihr dazu meine unzhligen, jammernden Bekundungen der letzten Zeit herangezogen?...~
@637  = ~Lasst mich das erklren... Als junger Drow waren mir Eure Gebruche fremd. Ich hielt Euch fr schwach und leichtglubig... Zu vertrauen bedeutet bei uns verraten zu werden.~
@638  = ~Spter merkte ich, dass Ihr gerade durch dieses Vertrauen und die Gemeinschaft, die Ihr daraus untereinander formt, stark seid. Ich lernte Respekt Euch gegenber.~
@639  = ~Und nun bin ich hier... und beneide Euch darum.~
@640  = ~Auch Ihr seid nun Teil einer solchen Gemeinschaft.~
@641  = ~Nun, als Drow werdet Ihr diese Gemeinschaft wohl leider nie wirklich erfahren.~
@642  = ~Ich bin ein Drow. Nicht nur meine Vergangenheit macht mich zu einem, auch mein Aussehen verrt mich, und ich werde es nie ablegen knnen. Ihr seid freundlich zu mir, aber werdet Ihr und Euresgleichen mich je als einen von Euch betrachten? Ich wage es zu bezweifeln.~
@643  = ~Ich vertraue Euch. Alles andere liegt bei Euch.~
@644  = ~So sehr, wie es unter den Umstnden geht. Euer Aussehen knnt Ihr nicht verndern, wie Ihr schon richtig bemerkt habt, aber das Verhalten der anderen wird auch stark durch Euer eigenes beeinflusst.~
@645  = ~Das erwartet Ihr nicht ernsthaft, oder? Ihr seid nunmal Drow.~
@646  = ~Das ist nur zu wahr.~
@647  = ~Ich bin und bleibe Drow... zumindest fr die anderen.~
@648  = ~Und doch habe ich mich gendert. Fr die Drow bin ich jetzt schon nur noch Spinnenfra...~
@649  = ~Ich kann das Verhalten anderer nur bedingt durch meines beeinflussen. Es wird immer die Unverbesserlichen geben, die erst die Waffe ziehen, und spter fragen.~
@650  = ~Nun, ich bin es nicht anders gewohnt. Aber Eure Gesellschaft htte so viele Mglichkeiten, es anders zu machen...~
@651  = ~Nun, so htten es die Drow, vermute ich. Wenn man es denn schaffte, sie von ihrem Irrweg abzubringen!~
@652  = ~Das... sagt Ihr einfach so! Ich spre, dass Ihr es ernst meint... Ich kann nur unglubig mit dem Kopf schtteln!~
@653  = ~Ich... mchte Euch etwas erzhlen, <CHARNAME>. Ich erzhlte Euch, dass mir Sklaven Eure Sprache beigebracht haben. Nun, das war nicht gelogen. Die Situation war jedoch die, dass mir vielmehr *eine* Sklavin als Lehrerin gedient hat... Wollt Ihr die Geschichte hren?~ [c#ablank]
@654  = ~Sicher... Fahrt fort.~
@655  = ~Ich befrchte das Schlimmste, aber ja, ich mchte sie hren.~
@656  = ~Ich will das nicht hren, Solaufein.~
@657  = ~Sie wurde mir als Spielsklavin gewhrt aufgrund von Diensten, mit der ich die Mutter Oberin meines Hauses erfreut hatte. Nun, Spielsklaven leben normalerweise nicht sehr lange. Sie sind dazu da, ihre Besitzer bei Perversitten zu erfreuen, die diese sich ausdenken, und hufig sterben sie dabei...~
@658  = ~Solaufein - ich habe es mir anders berlegt. Ich will die Geschichte doch nicht hren.~
@659  = ~Auch damals schon fand ich keinen Gefallen am Ausfhren sinnloser Grausamkeit. Ihre Angst und Hilflosigkeit widerten mich an. Doch statt sie zu tten oder den Zofen zu bergeben verschonte ich sie.~
@660  = ~Ich begann, sie als Lehrerin fr Eure Sprache zu entdecken, und bald bten wir fast jeden Tag. Ich lie sie unbehelligt. Zu meinem Erstaunen wurde sie immer williger, mir als Lehrerin zu dienen.~
@661  = ~Es war eine merkwrdige Erfahrung, <CHARNAME>: Dass Menschen beflissen zu Diensten sind, weil sie *nicht* mit Strafen bedroht werden. Es war... ein kleiner aber uerst faszinierender Schimmer Eures Oberflchenlebens, den ich dort wahrnahm.~
@662  = ~Ja, das muss seltsam fr Euch gewesen sein.~
@663  = ~Ihr konntet es nur erfahren, weil Ihr ihr gegenber gndig wart.~
@664  = ~Die ganze Situation war seltsam. Ich hatte mich selbst zuvor noch nie so erlebt.~
@665  = ~Ich konnte sie jedoch nicht schtzen. Phaere - damals noch meine Vertraute - entdeckte uns und erschlug sie. Sie tat es zu meinem Schutz. Ich war wie besessen. Htte eine Zofe Lolths uns entdeckt, wre mein Schicksal grausam gewesen.~
@666  = ~Habt Ihr diese Frau geliebt, Solaufein?~
@667  = ~Diese Zeit habt Ihr nun hinter Euch gelassen.~
@668  = ~Das Mdchen tut mir unendlich leid, aber vielleicht war sie besser dran als manch andere dort unten.~
@669  = ~Ich danke Euch fr das Vertrauen, dass Ihr mir beweist, indem Ihr mir von Eurer Vergangenheit erzhlt, Solaufein.~
@670  = ~Das ist ja entsetzlich!~
@671  = ~Liebt Ihr den Hund, der Euch die Hand leckt?~
@672  = ~Ich fhlte etwas fr diese Frau, das sich ein Drow nicht erlauben durfte. Aber was nennt Ihr Liebe? Ich war vielmehr von der Situation gefesselt, unser Versteckspielchen faszinierte mich, wegen der verbotenen Frchte, die ich dort a.~
@673  = ~Einen schnellen und schmerzlosen Tod hatte sie. Um dies zu erhalten, knnen viele andere Drowsklaven nur ihre Gtter anflehen.~
@674  = ~Ich werde Euch beweisen, dass das Unterreich mit seinen grausamen Regeln keine Gewalt mehr ber mich hat, <CHARNAME>. Ich... wollte Euch das erzhlen, weil ich dachte, dass es Euch interessieren knnte.~
@675  = ~Nun gut.~
@676  = ~Angehrt habe ich es mir.~
@677  = ~Das... waren ausgesprochen feinfhlige Worte. Ja, so zu reden ist fr mich noch immer sehr ungewohnt.~
@678  = ~<CHARNAME>, ich habe die Sklaven gesehen, die Ihr zum Ausgang geschickt habt. Ihr habt sie freigelassen, nicht wahr?~ [c#ablank]
@679  = ~Ja, das habe ich.~
@680  = ~Wo habt Ihr sie gesehen?~
@681  = ~Ist das wichtig?~
@682  = ~Als sie auf dem Weg zum Ausgang waren. Ich hielt mich selbst bereits in den Schatten zu dieser Zeit, daher habe ich sie nur kurz beobachtet.~
@683  = ~Wenn es Euch nicht wichtig ist, dass Ihr sie freigelassen habt, dann ist das Eure Entscheidung. Mich aber hat ihr Anblick nachdenklich gemacht.~
@684  = ~Wieso das?~
@685  = ~Ich mchte nicht darber sprechen.~
@686  = ~Das war sehr gndig von Euch. Sie waren... zweite Wahl. Sie wren wohl Spinnenfutter geworden.~
@687  = ~Sie waren schlecht ausgerstet.~
@688  = ~Ihr hattet sie auergewhnlich gut ausgestattet. Nicht fr die Mission, die sie erfllen sollen, sondern im Vergleich zu ihrer... Qualitt.~
@689  = ~Es ist ein Wunder, dass die Torwachen nicht misstrauisch geworden sind. Diese Turbulenzen aufgrund des Krieges haben einiges ermglicht.~
@690  = ~Es sind nicht alle durchgekommen, aber...~
@691  = ~Es waren nicht nur die Strksten und Tapfersten, die es zum Ausgang geschafft haben, <CHARNAME>. Einige... einige haben sich fr die anderen geopfert. Ohne, dass sie es mussten.~
@692  = ~Sie haben entschieden, ihr Leben fr andere zu opfern.~
@693  = ~So funktioniert eine auf Gemeinsamkeit basierende Gesellschaft, Solaufein. Strkere opfern sich dann auch mal fr die Schwcheren, um sie zu beschtzen.~
@694  = ~Der eine oder andere fand sich wohl einfach in dieser Rolle wieder.~
@695  = ~Worauf woll Ihr hinaus?~
@696  = ~Vielleicht. Aber nicht alle. Ich habe einige ihrer Gesprche hren knnen.~
@697  = ~Das ist es ja, was ich nicht verstanden hatte.~
@698  = ~Es opfern sich unzhlige Drow, in jedem einzelnen Kampf, aber sie tun es, weil sie wissen, dass sie keine andere Wahl haben, als mit ihrem Tod die Spinnengttin zu preisen... Weil ihnen sonst auch der Tod, aber in grausamer und ehrloser Weise drohen wrde.~
@699  = ~Dies alles galt nicht fr die Sklaven, die kmpfend zurckgeblieben sind, damit die anderen sich retten konnten.~
@700  = ~Auch sie haben es vielleicht zu Ehren eines Gottes getan, das wissen wir nicht.~
@701  = ~Vielleicht war es eine Vernunftsentscheidung. Htten sie nicht gekmpft, wren womglich alle gestorben.~
@702  = ~Vielleicht.~
@703  = ~Die Sklaven hatten groes Glck, dass Ihr da wart und ihnen diese Mglichkeit gegeben habt.~
@704  = ~Wenn meine Brder und Schwestern Eure Worte hren knnten, wrden sie es zum Anlass nehmen, um die berlegenheit unserer Rasse zu preisen. Eine Gesellschaft, die die Starken sterben lsst und die Schwachen erhlt, muss unweigerlich schwach werden und untergehen, so denken die Drow.~
@705  = ~Auch die Drow wrden aussterben, wen sie ihre Kinder nicht schtzen wrden.~
@706  = ~Das macht nur Sinn, wenn Schwache immer schwach und Starke immer stark wren. So ist es aber meist nicht. Weder ber lngere Zeit, noch in Bezug auf unterschiedliche Bereiche des tglichen Lebens.~
@707  = ~Ihr meint, jeder bringe sich da am meisten ein, wo er oder sie am besten ist? Das ist eine schne Vorstellung, aber sie wird wohl auch hier an der Oberflche an den Eitelkeiten Mancher scheitern.~
@708  = ~Aber die Motivation dahinter ist eine ganz andere. Und die Art der Umsetzung ebenfalls.~
@709  = ~Es war gefhrlich fr Euch, die Sklaven in die Freiheit zu schicken. Es htte dazu fhren knnen, dass Eure Verkleidung auffliegt.~
@710  = ~Das Risiko bin ich eingegangen.~
@711  = ~Man trifft sich immer zwei mal im Leben, Solaufein.~
@712  = ~Es schien mir nicht zu riskant.~
@713  = ~Dann wre sie das eben. Ich hatte mich von vornherein auf Kmpfen eingestellt.~
@714  = ~So knnt nur Ihr sprechen. Ich kenne Euch gut genug, um zu wissen, dass Ihr Euch vor einem solchen Kampf nicht gescheut httet.~
@715  = ~Ihr meint... Dieser Spruch ist seltsam weise. Ja, ich glaube ich verstehe, wie Ihr ihn meint. Ihr nennt es auch "Eine Hand wscht die andere", nicht wahr?~
@716  = ~Das Konzept des gegenseitigen Helfens ist mir durchaus vertraut, und ich bin mir bewusst, dass ich davon bereits berdurchschnittlich provitiert habe.~
@717  = ~Ich sehe es auch als durchaus erfolgstrchtig an. Aber nur, solange ein Groteil die Prinzipien einhlt, und sein Verhalten nicht von Eigennutz leiten lsst. Oder es aus anderem Grund verweigert, zum Beispiel... Verzagtheit.~
@718  = ~Ich... ich habe den Sklaven nicht geholfen, obwohl ich es wohl gekonnt htte. Aber ich versteckte mich selbst bereits zu dieser Zeit, und ich fhlte mich nicht fr sie verantwortlich.~
@719  = ~Glaubt mir, diese ganze Sache gibt mir viel zum Nachdenken.~
@720  = ~<CHARNAME>, Ihr habt mich verwandelt. Erkennt Ihr noch den Drow, der Euch in Ust Natha gegenberstand? Ich habe mich Euch geffnet. Ich... vertraue Euch, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@721  = ~Es ist ein seltsames Gefhl... Und stndig berlege ich, ob es angebracht ist. Ob ich nicht doch zweifeln sollte. Ob ich unvorsichtig bin, nachlssig geradezu. Warum? Wird es immer so sein?~
@722  = ~Freunschaft wchst, und sie vergeht. Es ist abhngig von den Taten, die man tut, ob sie Bestand hat.~
@723  = ~Fr den einen mehr, fr den anderen weniger. Ihr seid aufgrund Eurer Vergangenheit eben besonders misstrauisch.~
@724  = ~Auch Freunde knnen einen verraten. Es ist in Ordnung, wenn Ihr Beziehungen, in denen Ihr seid, von Zeit zu Zeit berdenkt.~
@725  = ~Hm. Wenn Ihr so viel darber nachdenkt, dann vertraut Ihr mir aber doch noch nicht.~
@726  = ~Von einem Drow kann man wohl nichts anderes erwarten.~
@727  = ~Oh doch, das tue ich, <CHARNAME>. Denn ich frage mich vielleicht, ob es klug ist, aber ich drehe Euch den Rcken zu. Was anderes als Vertrauen ist dies? Aber es scheint, als msste sie jeden Tag aufs neue auf den Prfstand.~
@728  = ~Fr den einen mehr, fr den anderen weniger. Ihr seid aufgrund Eurer Vergangeheit eben besonders misstrauisch.~
@729  = ~Ja, ich msste Euch eigentlich tten, so nachlssig, wie ich mich Euch gegenber verhalte. Das zumindest wre die Drow-Herangehensweise.~
@730  = ~Ich habe nicht vor, Euch zu hintergehen. Ich berprfe auch nicht unsere Freundschaft. Ich stelle nur fest, dass Vertrauen schwierig ist, denn es ist ein Kontrollverlust, der mein Leben gefhrden knnte. Das zumindst habe ich die letzten Jahrhunderte gelernt und gelebt.~
@731  = ~Ich muss mich langsam an die neue Situation gewhnen, dass Vertrauen auch Strke bedeutet. Die Strke derjenigen, die sich aus freiem Willen freinander einsetzen. Wie sehr habe ich Euch Oberflchenbewohner immer darum beneidet! Und das tue ich noch immer, denn mich, mich strengt es an.~
@732  = ~Und doch ist es ein... schnes Gefhl. Ich fhle mich lebendig, so lebendig wie lange nicht mehr. Wer htte gedacht, dass so ein Kken wie Ihr solche Gefhle in mir entfachen knnte!~
@733  = ~Ich hatte Euch damals gesagt, dass ich eine Oberflchenrstung nicht mehr holen konnte...~ [c#ablank]
@734  = ~Die Wahrheit ist, dass ich mein Versteck mit der Oberflchenrstung nicht mehr plndern konnte, weil zu viele Feinde in der Nhe waren. Ich... ich habe es nicht gewagt. Ich frchtete, entdeckt zu werden. Und Ihr wart bereits auf dem Weg zum Ausgang.~
@735  = ~Ich habe es nicht gewagt! Nur, weil ein paar lumpige Drow sich in der Nhe der Felsspalte aufhielten.~
@736  = ~Ihr wart bereits sehr verunsichert ber Eure Entscheidung, an die Oberflche zu gehen.~
@737  = ~Ihr kamt gerade aus der Drinnenkammer. Da ist es keine Schande, einem Kampf auszuweichen.~
@738  = ~Ihr wolltet Euren Entschluss, unter meinem Schutz nach Anhngern Eilistraees zu suchen, nicht gefhrden.~
@739  = ~Das Verhalten war weise. Es war nur die Zeitnot, die Euch bedrngt hat.~
@740  = ~Das interessiert mich jetzt wenig, Solaufein.~
@741  = ~Umso wichtiger wre dann eine gute Rstung gewesen!~
@742  = ~Auch, wenn ich mich wissentlich in unbekannte Gefahr begab, und das ohne eine vernnftige Rstung?~
@743  = ~Meine Nervositt aufgrund Eures Voranschreitens mag zwar verstndlich sein, aber trotzdem war es kein Grund, mich wissentlich ohne angemessene Ausrstung in die unbekannten Gefahren der Oberwelt zu begeben!~
@744  = ~Doch irgendwie wollte ich lieber schlecht ausgerstet rechtzeitig zu Euch stoen, als gut ausgerstet Euch nicht mehr antreffen. Ich vertraute auf meine Kampfeskraft, naiv, wie ich war. Und stand dann geblendet und geschwcht in der aufgehenden Sonne und zweifelte ernsthaft an meinem Verstand.~
@745  = ~Ihr... Ihr glaubt nicht, wie sehr es mich beeindruckt hat, als Ihr mich trotzdem aufgenommen und ohne Zgern ausgerstet habt. Es war Euer dritter gndiger Akt mir gegenber gewesen, aber diesmal hatte ich mich selbst in Eure Hnde begeben... Ihr habt dort den Grundstein fr meine Freundschaft gelegt, <CHARNAME>, auch wenn ich es damals noch nicht htte benennen knnen.~
@746  = ~Trotzdem ist mir meine Verzagtheit dort hinter dem Felsvorsprung noch immer in uerst unangenehmer Erinnerung. Noch immer wei ich nicht genau, was mich damals angetrieben hat. Ich htte bleiben und um eine gute Rstung kmpfen mssen. Erst jetzt wage ich es, Euch dies zu berichten. Ich htte es vorher niemals zugegeben. Eher htte ich behauptet, die Rstung wre gestohlen worden!~
@747  = ~Hmpf. Das ist Euer gutes Recht, und doch stt es mich seltsam vor den Kopf: Dass Ihr meine Gedanken, die ich Euch erst nach so langer, reifer berlegung ausbreiten mchte, gar nicht hren wollt.~
@748  = ~Nun, das Leben ist voller berraschungen.~
@749  = ~<CHARNAME>, seid Ihr... zufrieden mit mir? Es ist ungewhnlich fr mich, dies direkt zu fragen, aber ich mchte sichergehen.~ [c#ablank]
@750  = ~Ja, sehr.~
@751  = ~Inwiefern "zufrieden"?~
@752  = ~Wieso ist es fr einen Drow ungewhnlich? Sprecht Ihr die Dinge aus Angst vor Repressalien nicht direkt an?~
@753  = ~Nein, eigentlich nicht.~
@754  = ~Danke. Und doch muss ich Euch fragen...~
@755  = ~(seufz) Manchmal wnschte ich, Ihr wrt Drow. Ihr wrdet Euren Zorn an mir auslassen, und ich knnte so dazu beitragen, dass Ihr bei guter Stimmung seid. So bleibt mir nichts, als zu fragen.~
@756  = ~Ist unsere Freundschaft in Gefahr?~
@757  = ~Nein. Ihr seid und bleibt mein Freund.~
@758  = ~Was? Nein, seid nicht albern.~
@759  = ~Ehrlich gesagt war sie bereits seit lngerem beendet. Ich kann es nicht glauben, dass ich einen Drow als Freund bezeichnet habe.~
@760  = ~Repressalien? Es ist schon so mancher mnnlicher Kmpfer wegen geringerem als einer direkte Frage grausam hingerichtet worden. Deshalb geniee ich es, Euch direkt fragen zu knnen.~
@761  = ~Habt Dank fr diese Worte.~
@762  = ~Ich dachte immer, das Leben im Unterreich ist schwierig. Das richtige Verhalten, um keinen Zorn zu erregen. Sich nichts anmerken lassen, nicht das Falsche sagen... Nun merke ich, dass es hier nicht besser ist.~
@763  = ~Es ist sogar schlimmer, denn ich habe keinerlei Erfahrung. So kann es sein, dass ich Euren Zorn errege, und das frchte ich. Denn ich frchte die Folgen. Das macht mir mehr Angst als alles, was ich jemals in Ust Natha gefrchtet habe.~
@764  = ~Doch nicht etwa, weil ich um meine krperliche Unversehrtheit bangen muss. Nein, ich muss frchten, Euch zu verletzen, und damit Eure Freundschaft zu verspielen. Aber so ungewohnt und krftezehrend ich es auch finde, so wei ich doch, dass es die Anstrengung wert ist!~
@765  = ~Lasst uns weitergehen, mein Freund. Eure Aufgaben warten.~ ~Lasst uns weitergehen, meine Freundin. Eure Aufgaben warten.~
@766  = ~Ich habe jetzt endlich verstanden, was Drizzt Do'Urden damals sagte.~ [c#ablank]
@767  = ~Ist dem so?~
@768  = ~Was sagte er denn?~
@769  = ~Bezglich Freundschaft oder bezglich der Sonne?~
@770  = ~Das hat ja ganz schn gedauert!~
@771  = ~Bezglich Freundschaft.~
@772  = ~Freundschaft geht in beide Richtungen, nicht wahr? Selbst als ich die Eure bereits hatte, war ich ihr gegenber blind. Ich konnte Euch die meine erst geben, als ich mich entschloss, Euer Freund zu sein.~
@773  = ~Drizzts Aussage zur Sonne wird mir allerdings ewig ein Rtsel bleiben, obwohl mir natrlich viele Mglichkeiten einfallen, wie er es meinen knnte.~
@774  = ~Aber genug philosophiert. Wir haben die Auferstehung eines Gottes zu verindern!~
@775  = ~Findet Ihr? Ich fand mich ziemlich schnell, wenn man die Zeitspanne mit meinem bisherigen Alter vergleicht.~
@776  = ~Ich meine seine Erluterungen, was eine Freundschaft ausmacht.~
@777  = ~Lasst uns weiterziehen!~
@778  = ~Sicherlich. Ich... htte es merken mssen. Ich werde Euch in Zukunft nicht mehr mit meinen Gefhlsduseleien belstigen.~
@779  = ~Ich bin ein Narr, dass ich meine Gedanken mit Euch teilen wollte, ich werde es in Zukunft unterlassen! Es ist vielleicht besser so.~
@780  = ~Die Elfen wissen nicht, wieviel Glck sie haben. Jetzt, da das Haus Despana gefallen ist, werden die anderen versuchen, den Platz einzunehmen und sich gegenseitig bekriegen. Ich bin mir sicher, dass viele Kmpfer der Huser wieder in die Stadt gezogen werden.~
@781  = ~Zustzlich haben sie Verluste hinnehmen mssen, nachdem Ihr Euch durch die Auenposten geschlagen habt... Die Elfen htten Euch nicht so misstrauisch beugen mssen. Ihr habt ihnen da unten gute Dienste erwiesen.~
@782  = ~Da mgt Ihr Recht haben.~
@783  = ~Ich habe es nicht in diesem Wissen getan.~
@784  = ~Die Elfen tun nur ihre Pflicht.~
@785  = ~Sie werden trotzdem mit ausfallenden Drow rechnen mssen. Das Verschwinden des Silberdrachens wird mein Volk bermtig werden lassen.~
@786  = ~Jetzt bin ich also da, wo das grenwahnsinnige Haus Despana einfallen wollte: in der versteckten Stadt der Elfen. Aber ich bin hier, um sie zu erhalten.~
@787  = ~So ist es.~
@788  = ~Ja, und ich hoffe fr Euch, dass Ihr dies auch tun werdet.~
@789  = ~Nun, nachdem der gute Elhan seine Magie auf mich losgelassen hat, bleibt mir auch nichts anderes brig.~
@790  = ~Sorgt Euch nicht um meine Loyalitt Euren Zielen gegenber.~
@791  = ~Allein der Gedanke, wie zornig die Zofen Lolths wren, wenn sie mich hier sehen knnten, treibt mir eine solche Schadenfreude ins Gesicht, dass es sich lohnt, den Elfen zu helfen.~
@792  = ~Aber nicht nur dies, sondern auch die Worte meiner Dame mit dem Silberhaar lsst es mich als gut erkennen, das bel von dieser Stadt der Oberflchenelfen abzuwenden.~
@793  = ~Also haben wir tatschlich den legendren Drizzt Do'Urden getroffen. Niemand spricht ber ihn, und doch kennt jedes Drowkind seinen Namen. Ich danke Euch.~
@794  = ~Fr das Treffen? Das habe ich nicht verursacht.~
@795  = ~Wofr?~
@796  = ~In der Tat. Lasst uns weiterziehen.~
@797  = ~Ich danke Euch dafr, dass Ihr Euch nicht eingemischt habt, als er mich wie ein Jungmnnchen zusammengestaucht hat. Nun, er hatte wohl Recht. Mein Alter gilt hier nichts, meine langjhrige Erfahrung ebenso wenig.~
@798  = ~Also, Eure Kmpferfhigkeiten und Magie sind hier durchaus ntzlich.~
@799  = ~Nehmt es Euch nicht allzusehr zu Herzen, Solaufein.~
@800  = ~Ich wrde gerne etwas zu seinen Worten hinzufgen.~
@801  = ~Natrlich. Ihr wisst aber, was ich meinte.~
@802  = ~So?~
@803  = ~Freundschaft heit auch, dass es nicht kmmert, in welcher Sprache Ihr zu anderen sprecht, wisst Ihr? Hflichkeit bedeutet, dass man sich auch in einer Sprache ansprechen lsst, die man ungern hrt. Und Vertrauen heit, dass der andere es toleriert, wenn Ihr in einer Sprache sprecht, die er nicht versteht. So, das wollte ich mal gesagt haben.~
@804  = ~Er hat Recht mit dem, was er sagte. Ihr msst noch eine Menge lernen.~
@805  = ~Nun, Ihr werdet es schon schaffen, zu finden, was Ihr sucht.~
@806  = ~Aber doch, das tue ich, <CHARNAME>, und ich denke, dass es das einzig Richtige ist, was ich mit seinen Worten tun kann.~
@807  = ~Dem ist wohl nichts hinzuzufgen.~
@808  = ~Ich... danke Euch, Ja, was Ihr sagt, macht Sinn. Es ist die Seite des anderen, nicht wahr? Ich frage mich, warum er mir diese Seite nicht gesagt hat. Es liegt wohl daran, dass ich zuerst die Seite verstehen muss, die er mir erlutert hat.~
@809  = ~Ich muss in der Tat noch einen weiten Weg gehen, um dort anzukommen: Ich habe in meinem Trotz, von ihm zurechtgewiesen zu werden, vergessen, mich bei ihm fr seinen Rat zu bedanken.~
@810  = ~Seine Worte haben mir genug zum Nachdenken gegeben, <CHARNAME>. Ich sehe daher Euer Versprechen erfllt, mich mit Gleichgesinnten zusammenzubringen. Lasst uns nun weiter Eure Feinde verfolgen.~
@811  = ~Welch Ruhe...~
@812  = ~Noch vor nicht allzu langer Zeit wre mein einziger Gedanke in diesem Tempel der gewesen, ihn auszuplndern.~
@813  = ~Nun stehe ich hier in diesem ruhigen Dmmerlicht und geniee die friedliche Stimmung.~
@814  = ~Der Morgen dmmert. In meinem frheren Leben bedeutete er Entdecktwerden, Verrat und Tod. Ein Drow, der es vor der Morgendmmerung nicht von seinem Streifzug von der Oberflche zurck in die Dunkelheit geschafft hatte, war so gut wie tot.~
@815  = ~Nicht nur die Oberweltler waren mit dem aufgehenden Licht im Vorteil in einem Kampf, auch die Sonne selber empfinden die Drow als Feind, mit ihrem grellen, versengenden Licht.~
@816  = ~Nun bin ich hier und kann das Lichterspiel genau betrachten. Eben noch war es sanft... und nun blendet die Sonne noch strker, weil sie so tief steht.~
@817  = ~(schnaubt) Lasst uns weiterziehen und diesen nchsten grellen Tag hinter uns bringen.~
@818  = ~(unterdrckter Laut) Diese Sonne!...~
@819  = ~(schnaubt) Jetzt wei ich, wie sich das Opfer eines Betrachters fhlt, schwcher mit jedem Strahl... Daran soll man sich gewhnen knnen?~
@820  = ~Selbst fr unsere Augen ist direkte Sonneneinstrahlung kaum zu ertragen. Wie schlimm muss es erst fr Euch sein!~
@821  = ~Das msst Ihr wohl.~
@822  = ~Das hoffe ich. Ihr seid mir nicht von groem Nutzen, wenn ich Euch an der Hand fhren muss!~
@823  = ~Das steht auer Frage. Wie abfllig sprechen die Drow ber ihre in der Dunkelheit fast blinden Sklaven. Nun erfahre ich dasselbe.~
@824  = ~Ihr zeigt groes Verstndnis, wo ich Verachtung erwartet htte.~
@825  = ~Eure Worte sind erstaunlich nchtern.~
@826  = ~Wie abfllig sprechen die Drow ber ihre in der Dunkelheit fast blinden Sklaven! Nun erfahre ich die gleiche Behinderung, aber nicht dieselbe Reaktion.~
@827  = ~(schnaubt) Und hier ist wieder die Sonne, direkt in meinem Gesicht.~
@828  = ~Wie sehr sich Euer Verhalten in der Sonne gendert hat, Solaufein. Ihr meidet sie nicht mehr.~
@829  = ~Sonnenbaden knnt Ihr ein andermal, Solaufein, wir haben viel zu tun.~
@830  = ~Ich versuche die Sonne zu ertragen, <CHARNAME>. Eines Tages werde ich sie gerne auf meiner Haut spren, das hoffe ich zumindest. Ich habe gemerkt, dass ich mich geblendet von der Sonne genauso auf meine anderen Sinne verlassen kann wie in der Dunkelheit der Unterwelt. Es waren die ungewohnten, seltsam anmutenden Gerusche und anderen Sinneseindrcke, die mich so irritierten.~
@831  = ~Und vor allem fhlen sich Drow in der Sonne unwohl, da sie uns gnadenlos an unsere Feinde preisgibt. Noch immer kmpfe ich gegen dieses Gefhl der absoluten Entblung an, wenn ihr Strahl mich trifft. Aber ich werde es berwinden. Mir bleibt keine andere Wahl.~
@832  = ~Hmpf. Euer Sinn fr Humor ist berwltigend!~
@833  = ~(schttelt sich) Hmpf. Ich hatte nie geglaubt, dass es mir einmal klter erscheinen wrde als in den Tiefen des Unterreichs, aber hier, durchnsst und im Wind, beginne ich zu zittern wie ein nacktes Kleinkind. Dass es nicht so hell ist, ist der einzige Vorteil dieses Wetters!~
@834  = ~Ich empfinde eine seltsame Sehnsucht nach den wrmenden Strahlen der Sonne. Ich frchte allerdings, dass ich mich nicht mehr daran erinnern werde, wenn sie wirklich wieder zum Vorschein kommt.~
@835  = ~Der Mond!...~
@836  = ~Verzeiht. Ich hatte noch nie vorher Gelegenheit, das Zeichen meiner verehrten Gttin in Ruhe zu betrachten.~
@837  = ~Aber gesehen habt Ihr ihn bereits?~
@838  = ~Ist schon in Ordnung. Ihr spracht ja bereits davon, wie gerne Ihr ihn sehen wrdet. Nun habt Ihr Zeit dazu.~
@839  = ~In der Tat! Als echter Anhnger Eilistraees knnt Ihr jetzt die Kleider ablegen und durch die Nacht tanzen.~
@840  = ~Das habt Ihr auch jetzt nicht. Wir haben was zu erledigen!~
@841  = ~Als ich ihn das letzte Mal htte betrachten knnen, war ich nicht einmal halb so alt wie jetzt, und noch ein hochambitionierter Drowkmpfer, den Kopf gefllt mit den Dogmen der Spinnengttin. Das Licht des vollen Mondes htte mich nur geblendet und verraten.~
@842  = ~Aber ich wollte nicht mig erscheinen... Ich werde ab und zu hochschauen, whrend wir voranschreiten. Ich geniee das im Vergleich zur Sonne sanfte Licht, das ich nun uneingeschrnkt bewundern kann.~
@843  = ~Das ist in Ordnung. Ich wollte nicht mig erscheinen. Ich werde nun wohl noch hufiger Gelegenheit dazu finden, die leuchtende Scheibe am Himmel zu bewundern.~
@844  = ~Nicht wirklich. Der volle Mond ist viel zu hell, als dass sich die Drow in seinem Licht wohlfhlen wrden. Nicht, dass er uns blenden wrde, aber die Dunkelheit durchdringt der Mondschein durchaus und erschwert das Verstecken im Schatten.~
@845  = ~(schnaubt)~
@846  = ~Sie werden Eurer nchsten Aussage aufmerksam lauschen, besonders da Ihr Euch bereits schuldig gemacht habt, weil Ihr mit einem Drow reist.~
@847  = ~Aber sicher, ich hab' doch Solaufein bei mir, oder nicht? Das bedeutet, dass ich ein Diener der Drow sein *muss*.~
@848  = ~Besonders weil da immer noch dieser Drow ist, der mit Euch reist. Auf ihn komme ich spter zurck, seid dessen gewiss.~
@849  = ~Passt auf den Drow, der bei Euch ist, auf. Seit ihrem Untergang hat keiner seiner Art mehr die Schnheit einer Stadt der Elfen erblickt. Ich wrde ihm die Augen verbinden, wenn ich knnte. Andere htten ihm die Augen ausgestochen.~
@850  = ~Unglcklicherweise muss ich jetzt noch einen letzten Streitpunkt zur Sprache bringen. Ich sagte, ich wrde zu dem Drow zurckkehren, und jetzt ist die Zeit dafr gekommen. Ich werde nicht zulassen, dass er Euch begleitet.~
@851  = ~Ihr kommt zurck! Aber was sehe ich da? Ein weiterer Drow, mitten in Euren Reihen! Habt Ihr Euch von Eurem Versprechen abgewandt, dass Ihr einen unserer Feinde mit Euch ziehen lasst?!~
@852  = ~Ich bin nicht hier um Eure Stadt zu gefhrden, Elhan. Ich stehe vor Euch, weil ich den Drow den Rcken gekehrt habe.~
@853  = ~Dann bringt ihn eben um. Das wird Euer kleines Problem lsen.~
@854  = ~Ich kann dies nur mit der mir vertrauten Gruppe erledigen. Er muss mich begleiten.~
@855  = ~Es gibt nur eine Bedingung, unter der ich das zulassen kann. Er muss als erstes Euch und Eurer Sache die Treue schwren, <CHARNAME>.~
@856  = ~Das tue ich ohne zu zgern, Elhan. Ich schwre <CHARNAME> die Treue, solange <PRO_HESHE> meine Untersttzung bentigt.~
@857  = ~Und er muss einem geistigen Brandzeichen zustimmen. Das ist die einzige Mglichkeit.~
@858  = ~Ein... ein magischer Knebel? Ich wei, dass es viel verlangt ist, mir zu glauben, Elhan, aber ich werde Euch auch ohne eine solche Manahme nicht hintergehen.~
@859  = ~Wenn das getan ist, sind alle meine Zweifel ausgerumt, Solaufein. Wenn Ihr uns verratet, wird es Euer Tod sein, nur so lasse ich es zu.~
@860  = ~Ich habe geschworen, <CHARNAME> zu untersttzen. Verpasst mir also Euer magisches Zeichen, wenn es sein muss.~
@861  = ~Ich hoffe sehr, dass Ihr Euch mit dieser Bemerkung in Sarkasmus bt, <CHARNAME>.~
@862  = ~Nun sollte es gut sein... Geht also und bringt die Lanthorpe. Aber es wre mir lieber gewesen, wenn Ihr Euch nicht mit Drow verbndet httet, <CHARNAME>!~
@863  = ~Kommen wir also zu dem zweiten Drow, der Euch begleitet... Wenn meine Magier nicht Eure Intentionen so gut durchschauen knnten, wrde ich nicht glauben, dass Ihr nicht mit den Drow zusammenarbeitet.~
@864  = ~Solaufein, auch Ihr seid nun an die Aufgabe gebunden, und ich frchte keinen Verrat.~
@865  = ~Nein, das kann ich nicht untersttzen, <CHARNAME>. Dieser Drow steht fr das, was ich erreichen mchte!~
@866  = ~Ein Drow, der an meiner Seite kmpft! Das ist lange nicht mehr geschehen.~
@867  = ~Ah. Also habt Ihr wegen des Rufes, den mein Volk geniet, angegriffen? Warum gehrt dann ein Drow zu Eurer Gruppe? Ich kann nicht erkennen, dass Ihr ihn angreift.~
@868  = ~Solaufein ist ein Ausgestoener, und er hat bewiesen, dass man ihm vertrauen kann.~
@869  = ~Ich traue ihm nicht mehr als Euch. Er ist bei mir, weil er mir von Nutzen ist.~
@870  = ~Solaufein ist einzigartig unter den Drow, und mein Vertrauen zu ihm ist absolut.~
@871  = ~Er ist also ein Drow, aber Ihr metzelt ihn nicht nieder. Was hab' ich dann mir zuschulden kommen lassen? Ich habe mein Volk verlassen... Ihr werdet feststellen, dass ich ganz anders bin, sogar als Euer Drow-Freund.~
@872  = ~Interessant. Vielleicht seid Ihr nicht derselbe <PRO_RACE>, dem ich begegnet bin. Viel kann sich in einer relativ kurzen Zeitspanne verndern... das wei ich wohl.~
@873  = ~Wartet!~
@874  = ~Ihr seid Drizzt Do'Urden aus Menzoberranzan? Ein Anhnger Eilistraees! Ich bin auf der Suche nach Euch... nach solchen wie Euch.~
@875  = ~Hm, schn zu hren. Doch ich sehe Euch in Begleitung dieses <PRO_RACE>en. Seid Ihr sicher, dass Ihr Euch die richtige Fhrung fr dieses Vorhaben ausgesucht habt?~
@876  = ~Ich wei nicht, was zwischen Euch vorgefallen ist. Zu mir war <CHARNAME> gndig.~
@877  = ~Das hre ich nur zu gern. Verzagt nicht. Ihr werdet hier oben viele Eurer Fhigkeiten verlieren. Dafr werdet Ihr eine Freiheit finden, die Ihr Euch nicht habt vorstellen knnen.~
@878  = ~Wobei ich keine falschen Hoffnungen schren mchte. Ihr seid der Feind der Oberweltler, und der Groteil wird Euch immer feindlich gesinnt bleiben und Euch jagen, egal, was Ihr tut. Merkt Euch das, und sucht Euch die wenigen, die Euch wohlgesonnen sind.~
@879  = ~Gebt die Suche nicht auf, Freund. Aber vergesst vor Suchen nicht, der Welt um Euch herum Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken. Es knnte sonst sein, dass Ihr einen Freund berseht.~
@880  = ~Ich... Usstan inbal ulu joros nin. Vel'bol zhah folggash?~
@881  = ~Meine Ohren haben Laute dieser Sprache lange nicht mehr vernommen. Warum fragt Ihr mich das? Warum fragt Ihr nicht Euren Begleiter?~
@882  = ~Ist das nicht offensichtlich? Wir haben mehr Gemeinsamkeiten. Ihr knnt es mir so erklren, dass ich es verstehe.~
@883  = ~Ihr traut mir viel zu. Wie soll ich etwas in ein paar Stzen erklren, das man ber lngere Zeit selbst erleben muss, um es zu verstehen? Aber ich will nicht unhflich sein, und es versuchen.~
@884  = ~Aber zuerst stellt die Frage so, dass Euer Begleiter sie auch verstehen kann.~
@885  = ~Ich... ich fragte, wie ich Freundschaft erkennen kann.~
@886  = ~Freundschaft basiert auf Vertrauen. Solange Ihr Eurem Gegenber nicht vertraut, nennt Ihr ihn auch nicht Euren Freund.~
@887  = ~Freundschaft heit aber auch, dass Ihr es nicht ntig habt, in einer Sprache zu sprechen, die der andere nicht versteht, weil Ihr einem Freund alles sagen knnt.~
@888  = ~Um Freunde zu gewinnen, msst Ihr hflich sein. Und Hflichkeit, mein Freund, bedeutet, dass Ihr einen Fremden nicht in einer Sprache ansprecht, die dieser seit Jahrzehnten versucht zu vergessen.~
@889  = ~Ich...~
@890  = ~Verzeiht.~
@891  = ~Nun, ich denke, ich verstehe, warum Ihr diese Sprache fr Eure Frage gewhlt habt. Ihr habt die grausame Welt dort unten hinter Euch gelassen, aber ich sehe Euch an, dass es Euch bewusst ist, dass diese mindestens ebenso grausam sein kann. Ihr seid nervs, und Ihr fhlt Furcht. Furcht, dass man Euch Eure Unerfahrenheit als Schwche auslegt.~
@892  = ~Freundschaft heit aber auch, dass der andere Eure Schwchen nicht ausnutzt, und Euch zur Seite steht, egal, ob im Kampf oder beim Beantworten von Fragen.~
@893  = ~Wie ich bereits sagte, Ihr msst noch einen weiten Weg gehen, um dorthin zu kommen. Ihr habt groen Mut gezeigt, das Unterreich und die grausame Welt der Drow zu verlassen. Ich respektiere das.~
@894  = ~(schnaubt) Mut? Wenn Ihr es so nennen wollt. Ich *floh* von dort, verraten und schutzlos.~
@895  = ~Ja, Mut. Denn nur der ist mutig, der seine Angst bezhmt. Und deshalb habe ich Hoffnung, dass Ihr es schaffen werdet, Freunde zu finden. Vergesst nie: Die Sonne ist nicht Euer Feind.~
@896  = ~Aber nun, meine Freunde, mssen wir uns wieder auf den Weg machen.~
@897  = ~In case I complained about people *looking* hostile, I herewith take it back. Good man, I impose no threat to you. I came to the surface in search of those who are not evil.~
@898  = ~Drastic measures you suggest, but I do agree to your description of my fellow people.~
@899  = ~Now I do believe this will end badly.~
@900  = ~Zeit meines Lebens wurde mir eingeblut, dass die Elfen mein grter Feind sind. Nun droht uns grte Gefahr ausgerechnet von einem Elfen, der sich gegen sein eigenes Volk gewandt hat.~
@901  = ~Solaufein, der Drow, der sich von den Grausamkeiten seines Volkes abwenden mchte. Er hat sich Euch angeschlossen, nachdem Ihr ihn gerettet habt. Wird er Euch auch hierhin folgen?~
@902  = ~Das ist mein eigener Kampf, Solaufein. Ihr msst nicht mitkommen.~
@903  = ~Ihr habt gesprt, wie mchtig Irenicus ist, Solaufein. Ihr msst nicht mitkommen.~
@904  = ~Seid Ihr bereit und entschlossen fr diesen Kampf, Solaufein? Ich muss mich auf Euch verlassen knnen, wenn wir da runtergehen.~
@905  = ~Nirgends, wohin Ihr mich fhren knntet, wre es so grausam wie dort, von wo Ihr mich gerettet habt, <CHARNAME>. Ihr habt mich vor der Verwandlung in eine Drinne bewahrt und mich unter Euren Schutz genommen. Dass ich Euch in Eurem Kampf um Eure Seele beistehe, ist das einzig Richtige.~
@906  = ~(schnaubt) Die Aussage, dass es nirgends so schlimm sein knnte wie dort, von wo Ihr mich befreit habt, muss ich in Anbetracht unseres Aufenthaltsortes zurcknehmen, <CHARNAME>.~
@907  = ~Aber ich bin hier, und ich werde Euch untersttzen, so gut ich kann. Und das nicht nur, weil Ihr wohl den einzigen Weg zurck zu den Lebenden darstellt!...~
@908  = ~Imoen, Ihr seid... auch ein Kind des Bhaal.~
@909  = ~Sieht so aus, ja.~
@910  = ~Eigentlich sollte es mich nicht berraschen, dass sich Kinder des Bhaal zumindest temporr zusammen tun.~
@911  = ~Nur, dass <CHARNAME> und ich uns zusammen getan haben, als wir beide noch nichts von unserem Erbe wussten.~
@912  = ~Genau, das ist...~
@913  = ~Moment mal, was meint Ihr mit "temporr"?!~
@914  = ~Anomen, Euer Gott ist der Gott der Pflichterfllung und des Pflichtbewusstseins?~
@915  = ~Ja, ist er.~
@916  = ~Es ist auch der Gott von Sir Ajantis, Solaufein. Warum fragt Ihr nicht ihn? Er kann Euch die Dogmen Helms noch viel besser erzhlen, als ich.~
@917  = ~Weil es so sehr viel interessanter ist, mit Euch darber zu sprechen, Sir Anomen.~
@918  = ~Warum fragt Ihr?~
@919  = ~Es geht Euch gar nicht darum, mich nach den Dogmen meines Gottes zu befragen, oder?~
@920  = ~In der Tat. Ich beobachte mit Interesse die inneren Kmpfe, die Ihr jeden Tag ausfechtet, um die Dogmen Eures Gottes zu erfllen.~
@921  = ~Ich msste mich von einem Drow beobachten lassen? Was macht Euch zu einem Experten fr meine "inneren Kmpfe"?!~
@922  = ~Nichts, wenn es um Euch persnlich geht. Aber ich erkenne sehr wohl die Haltung von jemandem, der innere Kmpfe austrgt, die er auf keinen Fall zeigen will, Sir Anomen. Dafr bin ich aufgrund meiner Herkunft durchaus jemand, den Ihr "Experte" nennen knntet.~
@923  = ~Starker Krieger aus Rashemen, ich sage Euch besser nicht, was ich dachte, als ich Euren Boo das erste mal sah.~
@924  = ~Ihr wart neidisch! Der Drowkrieger mchte auch einen kleinen Hamstergefhrten haben!~
@925  = ~h, nein.~
@926  = ~Ihr habt berlegt, ob Ihr noch eine Nuss brig habt?~
@927  = ~Nein... Minsk, das war in Ust Natha. Ich hatte Euren Hamster nicht als... Gefhrten identifiziert.~
@928  = ~Nicht? Als was denn dann?~
@929  = ~Nun... wofr man eben Tiere mit sich nimmt. Wie ich bereits sagte, schweigen wir darber.~
@930  = ~Jaheira, you might not be surprised if I tell you that I find it difficult to name most of the plants we encounter.~
@931  = ~Not at all.~
@932  = ~But it might surprise you that it is mostly because I see them firstly during the light of the day, not in the dim light of the night.~
@933  = ~That, indeed, is a reason I didn't expect.~
@934  = ~Solaufein, how much do you know about the surface world's flora?~
@935  = ~Not as much as I usually pretend to, Jaheira. But enough as to know that "flora" means plants.~
@936  = ~Ahem. Yes, indeed. Well, if you have any questions concerning the plants we enconter, especially the trees bearing fruits, eadible roots, and herbs, then do not hesitate to profit from my knowledge.~
@937  = ~You would teach me? I am surprised and humbled, Jaheira. I thank you in advance for your offer.~
@938  = ~It's not charity, Solaufein. <CHARNAME> decided we travel together, so I would prefer not to be incidentally poisoned at our next meal.~
@939  = ~I see. I will try not to poison you incidentally, then.~
@940  = ~That sounded... Never mind.~
@941  = ~Ihr schaut hufiger zu mir herber, Solaufein. Ist was?~
@942  = ~Nun... Ihr habt eine ungewhnliche Frisur, Mazzy.~
@943  = ~Bldsinn. Das ist nicht der Grund Eurer Blicke.~
@944  = ~Mazzy, mein Starren war das, was man gemeinhin als "unhflich" bezeichnet. Bitte verzeiht.~
@945  = ~Peh, Ihr wrt der erste, der mir was wegguckt. Es macht mich nur latent nervs, mich von einem Drow beobachtet zu wissen, auch wenn dieser vermeintlich auf meiner Seite kmpft.~
@946  = ~Mazzy, ich hatte Euch in der Tat beobachtet.~
@947  = ~Ich wei.~
@948  = ~Diese Ruhe! Diese Selbstsicherheit! Mazzy, Ihr jagt mir mehr Angst ein als die gute Imrae in einem ihrer Anflle.~
@949  = ~Nicht ernsthaft.~
@950  = ~Nun, sie hat mir definitiv mehr Schwerzen zugefgt, aber in gewisser Weise schon. Ich habe Euch beobachtet, weil mich Eure Kampfkraft beeindruckt, zusammen mit der Entschlossenheit, mit der Ihr Eure Waffe schwingt.~
@951  = ~Aber nur, weil Ihr es einer so kleinen Person nicht zutrauen wrdet. (seufzt) Also wieder die alte Leier.~
@952  = ~Jan, Ihr seid ein drolliger Gesell.~
@953  = ~Oha, auf eine solche Einleitung folgt meist nichts Gutes.~
@954  = ~Eure Art, Eure Geschichten, die Fantasie, die dabei mitschwingt...~
@955  = ~Fantasie? Das ist alles echt passiert und nichts als die Wahrheit!~
@956  = ~Genau das meine ich. Ich habe im Unterreich nie solche wie Euch getroffen. Unter den Drow natrlich nicht, aber auch nicht bei den anderen Vlkern. Wenn da welche waren, dann haben sie sich nicht gezeigt, natrlich.~
@957  = ~Ich wei schon, alles zu Ehren der Spinnengttin und nur die Zofen Lolths drfen ihren Spa haben.~
@958  = ~Drollig formuliert, aber sehr wahr.~
@959  = ~Der Elf mit der dunklen Haut hat sich also gewundert, warum Minsk einen Hamster bei sich trgt?~
@960  = ~Nun... Ehrlich gesagt, hatte ich mich in Ust Natha gewundert, warum Ihr nicht mehrere habt.~
@961  = ~Mehrere? Will der dunkle Elf denn damit sagen, dass er Hamster bei einem Krieger normal findet?~
@962  = ~Nun, wie gesagt... nicht nur einen.~
@963  = ~Ist dem so? Boo wrde jetzt gerne wissen, wofr die Krieger, die der dunkle Elf meint, denn die Hamster bei sich haben?~
@964  = ~Nun, wofr man neben Waffen, Munition, diversen Gertschaften und sonstiger Ausrstung eben durchaus auch lebende Tiere so mit sich fhrt... Starker Krieger aus Rashemen, ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, dass Ihr das nicht wirklich wissen wollt.~
@965  = ~Sarevok, ich habe noch nie eine Person erlebt, die so zielstrebig ihre Ziele verfolgt, wie Ihr.~
@966  = ~Zielstrebig... und erfolgreich!~
@967  = ~Erfolgreich? Ihr meint, weil ich das mchtigste Bhaalkind bin und die Welt vor mir zittert, wie ich es mir ursprnglich ertrumt hatte?~
@968  = ~Das Leben wre eintnig, wrden sich Ziele nicht im Laufe davon ndern, Sarevok. Der wahrhaft Erfolgreiche erkennt die Mglichkeiten, die sich ihm unter den gegebenen Umstnden bieten, und nutzt sie!~
@969  = ~Oh, es scheint, ich bin gerade auf eine Spinne getreten... Habt Ihr das Knacken gehrt?~
@970  = ~Man sagt, dass jeder Ruf einer gequlten Spinne von Eurer Spinnengttin gehrt und geshnt wird, Solaufein. Ist das wahr?~
@971  = ~Das ist nicht "meine" Gttin.~
@972  = ~Da hat sie sicherlich eine andere Meinung darber. Rechnet Ihr nicht mit ihrer Rache fr Eure Abtrnnigkeit?~
@973  = ~Ihr macht mir keine Angst, Korgan.~
@974  = ~Das war auch nicht meine Absicht. Ich frage aus reiner Neugierde.~
@975  = ~Ich befinde mich nun an der Oberflche, um ein weniger grausames Volk kennen zu lernen... Und doch wurden Euch die Flgel aufgrund der Bosheit von Menschen genommen, Arie. Ich wei nicht, ob ich enttuscht sein soll darber, dass ich sinnlose Grausamkeiten nicht mit dem Verlassen des Unterreichs hinter mir gelassen habe...~
@976  = ~Oder ob ich erleichtert sein soll, dass zumindest diese Grausamkeit nicht von Drow begangen wurde.~
@977  = ~Es... es gibt in jeder Gesellschaft Bses, Solaufein.~
@978  = ~Das ist wohl war, aber die Gewichtung ist doch stark unterschiedlich. Wenn es Drow gewesen wren, wrt Ihr nicht mehr am Leben.~
@979  = ~Das... das empfinde ich jetzt nicht wirklich als Trost, Solaufein.~
@980  = ~So war es auch nicht gemeint.~
@981  = ~Obwohl da mehr Wahrheit in Euren Worten ist, als es Euch vielleicht bewusst ist. Ich... ich wei sehr wohl, dass ich groes Glck im Unglck hatte, durch Quaile gerettet und aufgenommen zu werden.~
@982  = ~Mazzy, knnt Ihr es mir verbeln, dass mir Eure Gre auffllt? Als ich Euch das erste mal sah, habt Ihr mich an einen Oberflchen-Snirflebi erinnert.~
@983  = ~Eure Snirflebi waren wohl nicht so mutig?~
@984  = ~Oh, mutig waren sie, die Kleinen. Aber sie waren definitiv nicht so schlagkrftig.~
@985  = ~Ein Snirflebidorf mit Kriegern Eurer Kampfkraft, und die Drow in der Nachbarschaft htten ber kurz oder lang den Krzeren gezogen, Mazzy.~
@986  = ~Haha! Die Idee gefllt mir.~
@987  = ~Valygar, wie ich vernommen habe, habt Ihr Erfahrung darin, ein Leben im Verborgenen zu fhren?~
@988  = ~Ha! Wenn Ihr es so formulieren wollt, dann ja. Anders war es nicht zu haben. Alles, was ich wollte, ist Sicherheit zu haben und in Ruhe zu leben.~
@989  = ~Ein Ziel, das viele teilen... und ich gut nachvollziehen kann.~
@990  = ~Keldorn, Ihr schaut zu mir herber, und ich kann Eurem Blick ansehen, dass Ihr Euch nicht sicher seid, was Ihr von mir halten sollt.~
@991  = ~In der Tat. Eure Erscheinung stt mich ab, erinnert es doch an die Bosheit und Verdorbenheit der Gesellschaft, der Ihr angehrtet, und die Euch lange Jahrhunderte geformt hat. Es ist schwierig, Euch das nicht vorzuhalten.~
@992  = ~Die normale Reaktion auf die Zeichen meiner Herkunft. Ich kann es Euch nicht verbeln.~
@993  = ~Ich habe all das hinter mir gelassen, als ich das Unterreich verlie, Paladin. Oder zumindest versuche ich es.~
@994  = ~Jemand, der alles, was er vormals hatte und seine Heimat nannte, hinter sich gelassen hat, jeden Kontakt und jede Verbindung zu seinen Wurzeln abbricht, erfllt mich jedoch mit mindestens ebenso groer Sorge, denn eine solche Person hat nichts zu verlieren, keine Hemmungen mehr, nichts, was sie im Zweifel zurck hlt.~
@995  = ~Eine weise Ansicht.~
@996  = ~Cernd, what do you feel if you think about the Underdark? Is it nature to you like here, above? Or is it an abomination to what you believe in?~
@997  = ~Nature is the blooming, the breathing variety of live in it's multiple forms. I do not see this in the Underdark, drow.~
@998  = ~Oh, but there is a lot of life in the Underdark, sometimes at places you wouldn't expect. It's so much more than drow and spiders. If you only think about the vast amount of fluorescent fungi...~
@999  = ~It might be nature, Solaufein, but it is tainted. That is my belief.~
@1000 = ~Edwin, lasst mich das nochmal verstehen. Ihr habt Magie gesucht, die Euch unvorstellbare Macht geben sollte, und heraus kam eine Geschlechtsumwandlung zur Frau?~
@1001 = ~Bei den...! (Jetzt fngt der Idiot auch noch damit an.) Ich denke, es haben mittlerweile *alle* mitbekommen, aber danke, dass Ihr es noch einmal zusammen gefasst habt.~
@1002 = ~Es war mir gar nicht bewusst, dass es Zauber gibt, die in der Drow'schen Hierarchiedenke beheimatet sind. Grtmgliche Macht: Weibchen. Wirklich, eine durchtriebene, mchtige Zofe Lolths htte es sich nicht besser ausdenken knnen.~
@1003 = ~Die "Drow'sche Hierarchiedenke" war das letzte, was mir in diesem Moment vorschwebte, Drow!~
@1004 = ~Sicher. Es fiel mir nur auf.~
@1005 = ~Edwin, aus Euch werde ich nicht schlau. Warum seid Ihr noch immer an <CHARNAME>s Seite?~
@1006 = ~Gemeinsame Abenteuer! Lagerfeuerromantik! Tiefe, freundschaftliche Verbundenheit!~
@1007 = ~Ein Mann wie Ihr sollte zu Freundschaft fhig sein?~
@1008 = ~(Also, jetzt wird er frech.) Also, jetzt werdet Ihr frech. Wer spricht denn da gerade, hm? Habt Ihr das Scheppern und Klirren Eures Glashauses gehrt, als Ihr den Stein eben geworfen habt?~
@1009 = ~Da... da habt Ihr Recht. Ich bin in der Tat nicht der Richtige, um es anzuzweifeln.~
@1010 = ~Ha! Ich war ja noch nicht fertig mit meiner Aufzhlung. Das Schicksal mit beeinflussen! Die Sicherung des grten Stck Kuchens betreiben! Den anderen Bhaalkindern ins Gesicht lachen! Der mchtigste Magier von ganz Faern werden!~
@1011 = ~Nun, das klingt mir eher nach Euch.~
@1012 = ~Die Grnde knnen mannigfaltig sein! Sucht Euch einen aus!~
@1013 = ~Ich sehe Euch durchaus, Weibchen.~
@1014 = ~Ah, Ihr knnt also doch sprechen, Mnnchen. Ich hatte mir schon berlegt, ob ich Euren Respekt einfordern muss.~
@1015 = ~Respekt einfordern... Ach ja. Sind wir nicht alle hier, weil wir die Drowgesellschaft hinter uns gelassen haben?~
@1016 = ~Das heit noch lange nicht, dass ich mir von Euch Frechheiten gefallen lassen muss.~
@1017 = ~Haer'Dalis, I apologize, but I have to say it...~
@1018 = ~So, you are a tiefling.~
@1019 = ~Well spotted! And I have to say, I do believe you are a drow.~
@1020 = ~Indeed!~
@1021 = ~And I did see this, although you drow look one alike the other, for the eye untrained to the Underdark! This sparrow is a most resourceful one, is it not?...~
@1022 = ~Solaufein, I do have the impression that you are looking at me, is it not so, my black underdark wolf?~
@1023 = ~Solaufein, did you not encounter other tieflings in your city of black underdark wolves?~
@1024 = ~I admit I did, Haer'Dalis. I could not stop myself from wondering what my Matron Mother would have thought of you, would you and your actor's group appear at her doorstep.~
@1025 = ~Does the underdark wolf doubt we could entertain a Matron Mother?~
@1026 = ~Absolutely not. I am just not sure the entertainment the Matron Mother would make you do would have anything to do with you acting a theatractical play, Haer'Dalis.~
@1027 = ~I did, but only a few. Seldom there are visits from the outer planes to the realms of the drow, and if there are, the drow see to it stopping very quickly.~
@1028 = ~So, no story worth telling? No encounter that left an impression on you so great you would like to share it with the rest?~
@1029 = ~Whatever my experiences with tieflings' encounters in the past, Haer'Dalis, believe me if I say it's not a story you would like to act in a theatrical play for amusement.~
@1030 = ~Imoen, ich wollte letzthin nichts andeuten, was Eure und <CHARNAME>s Verbundenheit betrifft. Meine Wortwahl war ungeschickt. Ich bezog mich auf die Zusammenschlsse beliebiger Bhaalkinder, wie sie momentan aus Zweckgrnden bestehen.~
@1031 = ~Das ist mir schon klar, Solaufein.~
@1032 = ~Wobei die Wortwahl *wirklich* ungnstig war, wenn man bedenkt, dass <CHARNAME> und ich zwischenzeitig... nunja, getrennt waren.~
@1033 = ~Nun hrt schon auf, selbstkritisch die Stirn zu runzeln! So schlimm war es auch wieder nicht. Sonst bin ich noch Schuld an Euren Falten!~
@1034 = ~Mazzy, Ihr wirkt erstaunlich unaufgeregt ob der ganzen Vorkommnisse, die uns momentan mit <CHARNAME> geschehen.~
@1035 = ~Jetzt hektisch zu werden wre kontraproduktiv. Ich kann mir eine Reduzierung meiner Kampfkraft nicht leisten.~
@1036 = ~Weise Worte. In der Theorie drfte sie wohl auch jeder verstanden haben.~
@1037 = ~Ihr wirkt aber auch nicht gerade aufgeregt, Solaufein.~
@1038 = ~Nun, es wrde auch nichts bringen, oder?~
@1039 = ~Wahre Worte.~
@1040 = ~Also, Anomen. Warum Helm?~
@1041 = ~Warum habt Ihr Euch fr den Gott der Pflichterfllung, der Wachsamkeit und der Verteidigung entschieden, wenn Euch ein Gott mit... impulsiver Agressivitt so viel besser stehen wrde?~
@1042 = ~"Besser stehen"?! Wie soll ich auf eine solche Frechheit reagieren?~
@1043 = ~Genau das meinte ich. Eure erste Reaktion ist impulsiv. Ah, ja, und jetzt sehe ich, wie sich Euer Verstand einschaltet, und Ihr Euch an die Dogmen Eures Gottes erinnert. Aber es ist ein immerwhrender Kampf fr Euch, nicht den ersten Impulsen nachzugeben, nicht wahr?~
@1044 = ~Wo soll dieses blde Geschwtz hinfhren? Unterstellt Ihr mir etwa, dass ich meinen Gott verrate?!~
@1045 = ~Was? Nein, habt Ihr mir nicht zugehrt?~
@1046 = ~Solaufein, knnt Ihr nicht nachvollziehen, dass ich mich an einen Gott wende, der verlangt, dass ich berlegt, aufmerksam und weise agiere?~
@1047 = ~Was ist falsch daran, sein Leben nach den Dogmen seines Gottes auszurichten, auch wenn es Mhsal und Selbstbeherrschung erfordert, Solaufein? Da ist nichts falsch daran, solange die Dogmen das verkrpern, was man in seinem Leben erstrebt!~
@1048 = ~Doch, sehr sogar. Und doch wre Euer Leben von sehr viel weniger Selbstzweifeln geplagt, wenn Ihr es nicht ttet.~
@1049 = ~Dieses Argument ist mig, und unbewiesen. Genausogut knnte ich Euch vorwerfen, dass Ihr Euch von der mchtigsten Gttin der Drow abgewandt habt, wo dies fr Euch doch so viele Komplikationen bedeutet. Und doch habt Ihr es getan, weil Ihr Euch in Eilistraees Glauben wiederfindet.~
@1050 = ~Wahr, und gut gesprochen.~
@1051 = ~Ihr haltet also Pflichtbewusstsein fr erstrebenswert?~
@1052 = ~Absolut!~
@1053 = ~Absolut? Nun, ich finde es erstrebenswert, aber nur, wenn es nicht zu sinnlosen Handlungen fhrt.~
@1054 = ~Sinnlos? Wann wre Pflichtbewusstsein sinnlos, Solaufein? Kommt mir jetzt nicht mit der Pflicht eines Ritters, fr andere sein Wohl zu opfern! Es ist niemals sinnlos, fr andere zu kmpfen!~
@1055 = ~Das meinte ich mitnichten. Nein, ich meinte den Ritter, der auf seinem Posten ausharrt, obwohl er es nicht msste - aus Pflichtbewusstsein. Er erreicht nichts, er bewirkt nichts, er laugt seine Krfte aus, fr nichts. Dann ist es sinnlos.~
@1056 = ~Aber dann hat Euer Ritter seine Pflicht vernachlssigt, auf seine eigenen Krfte zu achten, vorbereitet zu sein, seinen Platz zu kennen!~
@1057 = ~Wenn ich es nicht besser wsste, wrde ich Euch unterstellen, dass Ihr eine einfache Sicht auf die Dinge habt.~
@1058 = ~Solaufein, I am surprised of your little magic abilities.~
@1059 = ~Solaufein, calling my reason at <CHARNAME>'s side "adventuring" is not completely fair.~
@1060 = ~Well, <PRO_HESHE> did a great deal for me by fighting for me, so I feel kind of... obliged. But then... I just couldn't stay there any longer. It didn't feel like it is still my place.~
@1061 = ~Solaufein, can you not understand the urge to leave the limiting bonds of a home full of restrictions, a society full of rules and expectations concerning your appearance?~
@1062 = ~Imagining my aunt's face when we will meet again, after all *this*!...~
@1063 = ~...You did notice the part where I complainted about them greatly diminished since I left the Underdark?~
@1064 = ~I am talking about your ability to throw spells. You don't seem to be able to learn any.~
@1065 = ~Nalia, I am not a mage. I am a fighter.~
@1066 = ~But the drow are a magic race. They are supposed to have magic abilities far beyond of any surfacer.~
@1067 = ~We have. I have. Or when did you last see a fighter with the magic I have?~
@1068 = ~But it's not the same!~
@1069 = ~That, I am afraid, is a complaint you'd have to address someplace else.~
@1070 = ~Nalia, you set out to seek help to rescue your keep from a monster invasion.~
@1071 = ~And then you remained at <CHARNAME>'s side for what? Adventuring?~
@1072 = ~Oh, but it is so much more than that. I took it as an opportunity to get out and help making this world a better place.~
@1073 = ~We have that in common, have we not? You are also here because you set out to make your society a better place.~
@1074 = ~With the little difference that I am mainly at <CHARNAME>'s side because I am a refugee, hoping to find likemind drow while at the surface.~
@1075 = ~Well...~
@1076 = ~And from *there* I'll set out and try to make my people a better place.~
@1077 = ~I can relate to the sentiment... But it would be your home still, if you wish so.~
@1078 = ~Nalia, I fled from torture, brutality and death. The restrictions and rules you speak of seem of rather little impact in comparison.~
@1079 = ~That is because you are not trained to see the different shades of a surface world's life, Solaufein. I assure you my reasons to leave my home are well justified.~
@1080 = ~I did not say I doubt it.~
@1081 = ~You mean all the blood on our hands? Or the sand of these far away lands in our hair?~
@1082 = ~I *meant* the godly intervenience! The travelling at the side of the chosen one, the shaping of destiny!~
@1083 = ~Are we doing this?~
@1084 = ~Are we not?~
@1085 = ~So, what do you think she would say, your aunt?~
@1086 = ~(sigh) She would probably scold me for not wiping my boots appropriately upon entering.~
@1087 = ~Jaheira, what plant is this? It resembles a herb I saw in a book...~
@1088 = ~It is. Three leaves cooked together with your soup gives a well liked flavour.~
@1089 = ~Three leaves of this? In whole, or in tiny pieces?~
@1090 = ~In whole, and after the cooking, you take them out. They are not meant to be eaten.~
@1091 = ~So their spice is welcome but they themselves are not. I see. Thank you, druid.~
@1092 = ~Jan, es gibt aber auch noch einen ganz anderen Grund, warum es im Unterreich keine wie Euch gibt.~
@1093 = ~Weil sie bereits vor lngerer Zeit den Spinnen zum Fra vorgeworfen wurden?~
@1094 = ~Nein: Keine Steckrben!~
@1095 = ~Wa... Also, da habt Ihr mir doch glatt meine Zeile weggenommen!~
@1096 = ~Valygar, wurdet Ihr aufgrund Eures Versteckens in der Natur zum Waldlufer, oder wart Ihr es bereits vorher?~
@1097 = ~Die Verbundenheit zur Natur fhlte ich bereits vorher, und zwar sogar sehr stark. Ich glaube nicht, dass jemand, der sich auf der Flucht whnt, Vertrauen zu den Tieren der Wlder aufbauen kann, wenn er es nicht bereits vorher gesprt hat.~
@1098 = ~Jeder sucht sich wohl das aus, wo er sich am Wohlsten fhlt, wenn er sich verstecken will. Ein anderer wrde sich vielleicht besser in der Anonymitt der Stadt verstecken knnen. Das war aber nie mein Weg.~
@1099 = ~Ja, man muss sich dort verstecken, wo man sich am vertrautesten fhlt... oder ganz weggehen, weit weg aus dem Einzugsgebiet seiner Feinde. Letzteres habe ich nun getan...~
@1100 = ~Groer Krieger aus Rashemen.~
@1101 = ~Drowkrieger aus dem Unterreich!~
@1102 = ~Ihr habt Recht, die Anrede war berzogen.~
@1103 = ~Boo sagt, dass er diese Anrede gerne hrt. In Rashemen sind wir hufiger so genannt worden!~
@1104 = ~Hattet Ihr Boo denn bereits dort? Ich dachte...~
@1105 = ~Boo sagt, das ist nicht wichtig.~
@1106 = ~Wie Ihr meint, groer Krieger aus Rashemen!~
@1107 = ~Ich erzhle Euch spter, was ich fragen wollte.~
@1108 = ~Sarevok, Ziele und Mglichkeiten ndern sich im Leben, wie ich bereits sagte. Seht mich an, vor noch nicht einmal zwei Jahrhunderten htte ich jedem, der Lolths Namen besudelt, ohne zu zgern den Kopf abgeschlagen. Und nun...~
@1109 = ~Laufen wir beide mit <CHARNAME> durch die Gegend.~
@1110 = ~Ja, aber ich wurde von <CHARNAME> vor meinem Schicksal bewahrt, sonst wre ich jetzt nicht hier.~
@1111 = ~Gilt das fr mich nicht?~
@1112 = ~Was? Nun, wenn Ihr es so sehen wollt. Ich sehe eher, dass das berlassen eines Teils der Bhaalessenz der letzte Schritt war, der Euren Plan zur Erfllung brachte. Ihr hattet alles vorbereitet, konntet die Bedingungen stellen. <CHARNAME> hatte keine andere Wahl, als Euch wieder herzustellen.~
@1113 = ~Wenn Ihr es so darstellt, klingt es in der Tat groartig. Ihr habt aber die Verzweiflung und das Gefhl der Ausweglosigkeit vergessen, aus dem das ganze geboren war.~
@1114 = ~Imoen, dass Ihr und <CHARNAME>, aufgewachsen fast wie Geschwister, nun durch das Blut Eures gttlichen Vaters tatschlich das Schicksal der Bhaalkinder teilt, ist bemerkenswert.~
@1115 = ~(seufzt) Wem sagt Ihr das.~
@1116 = ~Wobei, ernsthaft betrachtet, <CHARNAME> bisher mit mir teilt, so zusagen. Ich fhle mich wie die begriffstutzige Schwester, die alles erst viel spter mitkriegt... Was nicht heien soll, dass ich tauschen mchte.~
@1117 = ~Imoen, Euer... Erbe zeigt sich?~
@1118 = ~Ich habe Trume... Das ganze erinnert mich verdammt an das, was <CHARNAME> durchgemacht hat.~
@1119 = ~Meine Hoffnung ist, dass <PRO_HESHE> das Schicksal bereits entschieden hat, bevor es bei mir richtig losgeht...~
@1120 = ~Da Ihr letzthin fragtet, Korgan: Ja, Lolth wacht ber ihre geliebten Spinnen, und sie shnt uerst gerne Vergehen an ihnen, oder besser gesagt, sie lsst shnen.~
@1121 = ~Wollt Ihr mir jetzt Angst machen?~
@1122 = ~Was? Nein, ich beantworte lediglich Eure Frage von letzthin.~
@1123 = ~Und ja, sie sieht mich hchstwahrscheinlich als Abtrnnigen. Inwieweit allerdings eine Gttin sich bemhen wird, mir nach zu stellen... Das halte ich nicht fr sehr wahrscheinlich.~
@1124 = ~Aber tretet ruhig weiter auf die kleinen Spinnen auf unserem Pfad. Wenn Ihr genug an Eurem Schuh kleben habt und wir noch immer zusammen unterwegs sind, dann erwecken wir vielleicht eher ihre Aufmerksamkeit.~
@1125 = ~Aerie, dass Ihr einen schweren Schicksalsschlag verkraften musstet, ist wohl war. Warum aber schwcht Ihr Euch selbst?~
@1126 = ~Was... was meint Ihr damit? Ich bin vielleicht nicht so stark wie Ihr, aber was gibt Euch das Recht, mich schwach zu nennen?~
@1127 = ~Avariel, ich habe nicht gesagt, dass Ihr schwach seid. Ihr beherrscht Eure Profession und setzt sie zu unserem Vorteil verlsslich ein, was trotz Eurer gezeigten ngstlichkeit auf eine mentale Strke hindeutet. Auch physische Strke erwartet niemand ohne die dafr ntigen Voraussetzungen.~
@1128 = ~Aber schwchlich seid Ihr durchaus, und es liegt zum groen Teil an Eurer Verzagtheit. Diese knntet Ihr berwinden, wenn Ihr wolltet.~
@1129 = ~Wenn ich wollte?!~
@1130 = ~Ja. Ihr schwcht Euch selbst, indem Ihr an dem versucht festzuhalten, was unwiederbringlich verloren ist.~
@1131 = ~D-Das sagt sich so einfach! Ich bin durch Grausamkeiten verstmmelt und meiner Heimat beraubt worden. Ihr knnt es wohl nicht nachvollziehen, Solaufein, dass dies nicht so einfach abzuschtteln ist.~
@1132 = ~Ich muss Euch eine gewisse... Bewunderung aussprechen.~
@1133 = ~Minsk ist es gewohnt, dass seine Krpergre und Strke bemerkt wird.~
@1134 = ~Nun, damit hat es indirekt zu tun...~
@1135 = ~Was ich sagen wollte: Es beeindruckt mich zutiefst, wie Ihr es schafft, fr dieses... Tier in Eurem Gepck zu sorgen, trotz allem, was uns geschieht.~
@1136 = ~Der Drowkrieger meint Boo? Minsk wrde Boo niemals zu Schaden kommen lassen!~
@1137 = ~Das wei ich, ich bin nur beeindruckt, dass Ihr ihn nicht versehentlich... zu Schaden kommen lasst, versteht Ihr?~
@1138 = ~Boo kann hervorragend auf sich selbst aufpassen!~
@1139 = ~Immer auf die Augen, ich wei, Minsk.~
@1140 = ~Valygar, wir sind in wenigen Wldern unterwegs in letzter Zeit. Vermisst Ihr die Tiere Eures Waldes?~
@1141 = ~Es ist eine fremde Gegend, in der Tat. Aber ein Waldlufer fhlt sich mit jedeweder Natur verbunden, Solaufein.~
@1142 = ~Nun seid Ihr aber weit fort, was Ihr nie wolltet.~
@1143 = ~Warum ich mit Euch darber spreche, wei ich nicht wirklich. Aber ja, wir sind weit von meinem Wald fort. Ich wre gerne wieder in meiner Htte, da im Wald, und wrde ein ruhiges, zurckgezogenes Leben fhren. Aber ich wei auch, dass das momentan nicht geht!~
@1144 = ~In meinem Wald knnte ich nichts erreichen, Solaufein. Die verngstigten Tiere wrde ich versuchen zu beruhigen, jeden Tag, und das Schicksal verfluchen. Nein, da kann ich hier in den fremden Landen an <CHARNAME>s Seite mehr erreichen, auch fr die Ruhe in meinem Wald.~
@1145 = ~Keldorn, wenn ich jetzt sage, dass ich die bsartige Indoktrination meines Volkes nicht komplett hinter mir gelassen habe, weil ich es gar nicht von jetzt auf gleich *kann* - ich also nicht alle Wurzeln gekappt habe, macht das meine Erscheinung in Euren Augen dann besser?~
@1146 = ~Wie bitte? Natrlich nicht.~
@1147 = ~Natrlich nicht. Ich wollte Euch nur mit Euren eigenen Worten aufziehen.~
@1148 = ~Obwohl, einen Versuch war es wert.~
@1149 = ~Ich werde Euch weiterhin gut im Auge behalten, Solaufein.~
@1150 = ~Das werdet Ihr, und ich kann es Euch nicht verbeln.~
@1151 = ~Cernd, do you not see the nature in the realms below the surface? All the animals. You do feel related to animals, do you not?~
@1152 = ~Animals? I do feel related to them, yes. But they are scarce in the Underdark.~
@1153 = ~What? But the whole Underdark is crawling with them! Spiders, night hunters, shriekers, sinisters...~
@1154 = ~These I usually call "monsters", Solaufein. Not animals.~
@1155 = ~Oh... Er, cavekkans?~
@1156 = ~Your attempt is mute, Solaufein.~
@1157 = ~Solaufein, I cannot imagine you are proposing the Underdark monsters to be animals. Do you really want me to believe that you drow call spiders "animals"?~
@1158 = ~Cernd, my druid, we do not.~
@1159 = ~So, why did you...~
@1160 = ~We usually call then "pets", Cernd.~
@1161 = ~The squalidness of the drow shows no end.~
@1162 = ~Sir Anomen, rarely I have seen someone as much in need of guidance as you are...~
@1163 = ~What insolence is this? Another attempt of telling me how insufficient I am?~
@1164 = ~Maybe. But my point is, that you are in need of guidance, and you chose well. Your god, your leader, both chosen wisely to attain your goals.~
@1165 = ~Wisely chosen? I did not chose Helm, as it was he who accepted my prayers to be his priest. I did not chose <CHARNAME>, as <PRO_HESHE> decided to take me as <PRO_HISHER> fighting comrade when I approached <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@1166 = ~Oh, but you did not betray your god, neither did you abandon <CHARNAME>, Sir Anomen, but let <PRO_HIMHER> lead you. You have far greater input to your destiny's shaping than you make yourself believe.~
@1167 = ~T'is a strange time to tell me that I have a say in my destiny, but... No, I do not believe in you complimenting me. I will turn your statement around until I'll find the insult that's hidden in it.~
@1168 = ~You are welcome.~
@1169 = ~Anomen, rarely I have seen someone as much in need of guidance as you are...~
@1170 = ~Maybe. But my point is, that you are in need of guidance, and you chose well. Your god, your leader, both chosen wisely to mirror your personality, to free you from any restraints and show your true colors.~
@1171 = ~Wisely chosen? I did not chose my god, as it was he who accepted me after Helm abandoned me. I did not chose <CHARNAME>, as <PRO_HESHE> decided to take me as <PRO_HIMHER> fighting comrade when I approached <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@1172 = ~Oh, but you let this god take you on, and you did not abandon <CHARNAME>, Anomen, but let <PRO_HIMHER> lead you. You have far greater input to your destiny's shaping than you make yourself believe.~
@1173 = ~Warum habt Ihr letzthin eigentlich so auf diesem Zauber herumgeritten, Solaufein?~
@1174 = ~Wollt Ihr mir vorschlagen, den Zauber meistbietend im Unterreich zu verscherbeln? Wie schade, dass wir dort bereits waren, und wohl nicht mehr so schnell wieder hinkommen! (Ein bisschen Ironie...)~
@1175 = ~Auf keinen Fall. Man wrde Euch nur auslachen. Wisst Ihr, ein einfaches Mnnchen kann seinen Wert in den Spinnengruben und bei anderen Kmpfen zu Ehren Lolths beweisen und so in der Hierarchie aufsteigen. Ein Weibchen dagegen ist ohne bestehenden Einfluss bereits so gut wie tot.~
@1176 = ~Ach, *schade*. Und ich hatte bereits auf eine annehmliche Nebenerwerbsquelle gehofft! (Ich hoffe, der Idiot erkennt Ironie berhaupt.)~
@1177 = ~Hm, es erffnet aber diverse Anwendungsmglichkeiten, um feindlichen Husern zu schaden. Eventuell wrde man Euch doch nicht so sehr auslachen, wie ich dachte.~
@1178 = ~(Nein, ich werde nicht weiter darauf eingehen. Genug geredet!)~
@1179 = ~Was macht Ihr hier, Viconia? Warum seid Ihr in <CHARNAME>'s Begleitung?~
@1180 = ~Euer Misstrauen ist Eurer Herkunft wrdig, aber ich muss Euch enttuschen, Solaufein. Ich wurde von <CHARNAME> gerettet, als mich diese hirnlosen Oberweltler verbrennen wollten.~
@1181 = ~Gerettet? Es scheint, <PRO_HESHE> findet wirklich groes Vergngen darin, Dunkelelfen in Not vor dem Tod zu bewahren.~
@1182 = ~Aber Ihr habt meine Frage nicht beantwortet. Warum seid Ihr noch immer hier?~
@1183 = ~Wo sollte ich sonst sein? Warum seid Ihr noch hier?~
@1184 = ~Jaheira, look at this plant. Is it useful?~
@1185 = ~Its leaves are very useful.~
@1186 = ~They are big, and rather soft. What do you use them for?~
@1187 = ~Well... As you noticed, they are soft. You use the leaves, to... Erm...~
@1188 = ~Well, just take some with you next time you leave for the bushes. Ahem.~
@1189 = ~I... see. How very thoughtful. And so much better as to the limited possibilities there are in the Underdark.~
@1190 = ~Solaufein, I did not intend to elaborate on the subject.~
@1191 = ~Jan, ich hatte letzthin wie im Scherz gesprochen, aber ich meine es ernst. Da ist keiner wie Ihr im Unterreich.~
@1192 = ~Weil es jeden nur einmal gibt?~
@1193 = ~Nein, weil es dort nur wenige gibt, die die Weisheit haben, zu sehen, wann sie nichts ndern knnen, und die Breitschaft, diesen Umstand zu akzeptieren. Und weil es dort niemanden gibt, der Liebe nicht mit Besitzenwollen verwechselt.~
@1194 = ~Oha, Dunkelelf, jetzt geht mir das zu sehr ins Persnliche. Das will ich bestimmt nicht mit Euch besprechen.~
@1195 = ~Auerdem meint Ihr bestimmt nicht mehr mich. "Weisheit" ist ein Attribut, dass mir das letzte 3/4 meines Lebens weitesgehen abgesprochen wurde.~
@1196 = ~Solaufein, Eure Worte letzthin waren drollig. Ha! Verbannt in der Hlle zu sein, kann auch seine Vorteile haben. Meintet Ihr das?~
@1197 = ~Zumindest, wenn man am Leben bleiben will und Kinder Bhaals als Geschwister hat, wie es scheint. Wie ich bereits sagte: Der Erfolgreiche nutzt die Mglichkeiten, die er hat.~
@1198 = ~Und hat dann hoffentlich die Weisheit, zu sehen, was er erreicht hat und gibt sich damit zufrieden.~
@1199 = ~Falls das eine versteckte Warnung war: Glaubt mir, ich habe eine Menge Weisheit gewonnen, als ich als Schatten in den Hllen umhertrieb.~
@1200 = ~Ich sagte nicht, dass es fr Euch einfach wre, das Vergangene hinter Euch zu lassen, Avariel. Was ich meinte war die Wahrnehmung Eurer Situation. Diese ist von Eurer Einstellung abhngig.~
@1201 = ~Nehmt mich als Beispiel. Ich bin aus meiner vetrauten Umgebung herausgerissen und in diese frchterlich grelle Sonne gestellt worden. Ich bin so gut wie blind und meine Haut wirft auch im Schatten nach kurzer Zeit Blasen. Und doch bin ich nicht unglcklich.~
@1202 = ~Ver-vergleicht Ihr ernsthaft meine Situation mit der Euren?~
@1203 = ~Ihr sagt, Ihr whrt verstmmelt und Eurer Heimat beraubt. Nun, ich bin ebenfalls meiner Heimat beraubt, denn ich kann selbst wenn ich wollte nicht mehr dorthin zurck. Und ich fhle mich verstmmelt, Avariel, weil die Sonne mir eine ewige Blindheit und verbrannte Haut beschert. Ich habe das Gefhl, geblendet in einem Lavapfuhl zu stehen. Zwar wrde dies vergehen, wenn ich mich wieder in die Dunkelheit begeben wrde. Aber dort ist kein Platz mehr fr mich, und so werde ich weiter wie ein Maulwurf durch die Gegend stolpern und <CHARNAME> um Wundheilung anbetteln.~
@1204 = ~Absolut betrachtet ist der Vergleich zum Verlust Eurer Flgel lcherlich, ich wei. Aber knnt Ihr Euch nicht vorstellen, dass es einen anderen Drow, der nicht freiwillig hierher gekommen ist, so sehr einschrnkte, dass er verzagen wrde?~
@1205 = ~Ein Drow sollte verzagen? Ich... ich dachte, das gibt es in Eurer Kultur nicht.~
@1206 = ~Auf die Art, wie Drow eben verzagen. Ich sage nicht, dass er den Mut verlieren wrde. Aber er *wrde* schneller zu Tode kommen, sei es aus bermut, Verzweiflung oder mangelnder Vorsicht aufgrund des fehlenden Glaubens in die Formbarkeit seines Schicksals.~
@1207 = ~Das ist es, was ich meinte.~
@1208 = ~Der fehlende Glaube in die Formbarkeit des eigenen Schicksals ist etwas, das ich nachvollziehen kann, Solaufein. Der Rest war ein komplett missglckter Versuch eines Vergleiches.~
@1209 = ~Keldorn, die Gesetze und Gebruche der Oberweltler bezglich des Zusammenlebens in Familien, vornehmlich der Bund zwischen einem Mann und einer Frau, sind mir noch sehr unvertraut, so faszinierend ich die Idee dahinter auch finde.~
@1210 = ~Wenn ich es richtig verstanden habe, hat Eure Frau...~
@1211 = ~Schweigt, Drow, und bleibt still. Ihr werdet nicht ber meine Familie reden.~
@1212 = ~Darf ich wenigstens fragen...~
@1213 = ~Nein! Kein Wort mehr.~
@1214 = ~Cernd, but what would you do, had you the power to eliminate the Underdark. Would you let it vanish? Would you turn it inside out, let the blooming, breathing life of the surface, as you called it, take it over?~
@1215 = ~That is a difficult question, drow. I am no god, it is mute to even think about it.~
@1216 = ~But all the disgust you feel. You surely have an opinion as to what would be best for the Underdark, could you change it?~
@1217 = ~I would... I surely would eliminate all the dark places, crawling with evilness, and...~
@1218 = ~(sigh) It is not that easy, it never is. I strive for balance, and balance can only be if there is equal weight on both sides of the scales. Where there is good, there has to evil, where there is light there has to be darkness to even it out. The more light and beauty there is in this world, the more evil and darkness there will be in the shadows of it - and it has to be this way.~
@1219 = ~That was a far more sensible answer than I expected.~
@1220 = ~Does that mean you think the Underdark is good, as it is? Seeing how it takes on the evil and darkness to even your beautiful surface nature?~
@1221 = ~(sigh)~
@1222 = ~Ihr jammert herum, wehleidiges Mnnchen, dabei habt Ihr nicht die Hlfte dessen erlebt, was mir widerfahren ist. Ich wurde nicht nur von den Drow vertrieben. Ich wurde auch von den Oberweltlern hintergangen, gefoltert und mit dem Tode bedroht.~
@1223 = ~Spielen wir jetzt "wem erging es schlechter"? Dann muss ich noch meinen Trumpf ziehen: Wart Ihr schon einmal in einem Drinnenkokoon, Viconia?~
@1224 = ~Ich sage doch, Ihr jammert! Wie ein Baby seid Ihr von einem Oberflchler in der Unterwelt abgeholt worden. Ich musste den Weg alleine gehen!~
@1225 = ~Hmpf. Ihr habt wohl Recht, dass es mir in meiner Anfangszeit an der Oberflche in <CHARNAME>s Schutz verhltnismig gut geht, im Vergleich zu Euch. Das will ich nicht abstreiten.~
@1226 = ~Und doch macht Ihr es Euch leicht, ber mich zu urteilen. Wieviel Ihr gejammert und geflucht habt, als Ihr alleine durch die Lande zogt, kann schlielich niemand erzhlen!~
@1227 = ~Jaheira, this plant there resembles the one you showed me for the... special purpose, if you recall.~
@1228 = ~Don't touch it! This is not the same that I showed you. This is a plant special to these parts of the Realms. This plant will make your skin prickle and sting!~
@1229 = ~You mean I shouldn't have gotten some when last I went behind the bushes?~
@1230 = ~Did you...?~
@1231 = ~No, because as you said, it made my hands prickle and sting. I am not masochistic enough to try it on other skin parts.~
@1232 = ~I am... relieved to hear it. But again, I did not mean to elaborate on the subject.~
@1233 = ~Jan, gehe ich recht in der Annahme, dass Ihr Euch gegen einen gttlichen Thron entscheiden wrdet?~
@1234 = ~Huch? Ich habe das bisher gar nicht auf mich bezogen. Was fr eine Vorstellung...~
@1235 = ~Aber Ihr habt Recht. Ich wrd das Erbe Bhaals mit seiner Hllenenklave in der Tat nicht annehmen.~
@1236 = ~Keine Steckrben!...~
@1237 = ~Hehe, ja, Ihr nehmt mir die Worte aus dem Mund.~
@1238 = ~Aber im Ernst, Jan. So drollig Ihr auch daherkommt, ich habe selten jemanden gesehen, der im entsprechenden Augenblick so unaufgeregt Entscheidungen treffen kann.~
@1239 = ~Ah? Das erinnert mich an Tante Lottinchen, als sie im Steckrbenweinbottich die Hausschuhe von Onkel Eugen gefunden hat. Eine sehr nette Geschichte!...~
@1240 = ~Ich habe auch noch nie jemanden getroffen, der so viele Leute mit seinen abstrusen Erzhungen zur Weiglut bringt, und trotzdem noch am Leben ist...~
@1241 = ~Aber erzhlt Eure Geschichte. Wer wei, wie lange wir noch Zeit dafr haben.~
@1242 = ~Aerie, ich wei, dass mein Beispiel letzthin hinkte. Nicht nur ist meine Blindheit temporr, im Gegensatz zu dem Verlust Eurer Flgel. Auch ist das Verlassen meiner "Heimat" zwar teilweise erzwungen, aber von mir durchaus begrt worden.~
@1243 = ~Von Euch zu verlangen, dass Ihr Euer Schicksal so bereitwillig annehmt wie ich meines, ist nicht angemessen.~
@1244 = ~Ich... verstehe trotzdem, was Ihr meint, Solaufein. Auch wenn ich Euch bitte, solche Vergleiche in Zukunft zu unterlassen. Ich gewinne sonst den Eindruck, dass Ihr nicht nachvollziehen knnt, was es fr einen Avariel bedeutet, die Flgel zu verlieren.~
@1245 = ~Nein, das wei ich auch wirklich nicht, da ich niemals Flgel besessen habe. Aber Eure Stimmung einordnen und Euch darauf hinweisen, das kann ich durchaus.~
@1246 = ~Es... es ist trotzdem nicht fair, meine mit der Euren zu vergleichen, und Ihr habt es bereits selbst eingesehen.~
@1247 = ~Welcher Vergleich, der zum Maregeln herangezogen wird, ist das schon. Ich kann Euren Unwillen verstehen.~
@1248 = ~Keldorn, nur eine Frage zu Eurer Familie, wenn Ihr erlaubt. Hat...~
@1249 = ~Schweigt! Ich sagte, darber werdet Ihr nicht sprechen.~
@1250 = ~Auch nicht als abstraktes Beispiel, damit ich Eure Gebruche besser verstehe?~
@1251 = ~Auch das nicht. Nicht ein Wort!~
@1252 = ~Warum nicht? ~
@1253 = ~Weil es... meine Familie ist. Und weil das Vorgefallene schmerzt.~
@1254 = ~Habt Dank. Ich denke, ich habe durch Eure Reaktion durchaus etwas ber die Gebruche der Oberweltler gelernt.~
@1255 = ~Viconia, ich... spreche Euch meinen Respekt aus. Ihr habt Recht, wenn Ihr meine Situation als komfortabel bezeichnet gegenber dem, was Ihr erleiden musstet.~
@1256 = ~Ihr knnt froh sein, dass wir nun in <CHARNAME>s Begleitung reisen, oder ich wrde Euch im Staub knien lassen!~
@1257 = ~Ich sagte Respekt aussprechen, nicht um Vergebung bitten. Ihr verdient meinen Respekt, wenn Ihr diese Zeit der Blindheit, Hitze und schwindenden Fhigkeiten alleine gemeistert habt.~
@1258 = ~Und doch bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob es nicht doch auch Vorteile htte, diese Zeit alleine zu verbringen. In diesem geschwchten Zustand auch noch smtliche Instinkte des Selbstschutzes ignorieren zu mssen, um die Freundlichkeit der wohlgesonnenen Oberweltler nicht zu brskieren, ist auf eine gewisse Art auch anstrengend!...~
@1259 = ~Gejammer! Geht mir aus den Augen. Meine Ohren klingen von Eurem Geheule!~
@1260 = ~Ich habe ber meine eigenen Worte nachgedacht, und eine Inkonsistenz festgestellt, Aerie. Ihr seid nicht schwchlich oder verzagt. Im Gegenteil, Ihr seid den Umstnden Eurer Situation entsprechend sogar sehr tapfer.~
@1261 = ~Dass... Dass Ihr das sagt, freut mich, Solaufein.~
@1262 = ~(schnaubt) Was nicht heit, dass Ihr nach meinem Geschmack nicht zu sehr mit Euren Gedanken in der Vergangenheit hngt... und es Euren Begleitern nicht viel zu hufig vorjammert.~
@1263 = ~Dabei... dabei habe ich letzthin gar nichts gesagt, obwohl ich es wollte.~
@1264 = ~Ja. Ich kam nicht zu Wort. Jemand... jemand beschwerte sich ausgiebig ber die grelle Sonne.~
@1265 = ~Ich... verstehe. Gut pariert, Avariel.~
@1266 = ~Keldorn, ich habe Euch letzhin beten hren... Ihr nehmt Eure Familie mit in Eure Gebete, jeden Tag.~
@1267 = ~Verwundert Euch das? Ich bete fr die, die ich liebe, Drow. Ist Euch das Beten fr andere so fremd?~
@1268 = ~Nun... Wir haben auch gebetet, fr unsere Mutter Oberin und die Zofen Lolths. Aber das war, weil wir es mussten, nicht, weil wir es wollten.~
@1269 = ~Der Gedanke, fr jemanden zu beten, weil dessen Wohlergehen einem einfach nur am Herzen liegt... Ich habe es noch nie gefhlt.~
@1270 = ~Ihr habt jetzt die Mglichkeit, diese Erfahrung zu machen, Solaufein. Wahre Freunde zu finden, die Ihr um ihrer selbst willen liebt.~
@1271 = ~Ihr meint, falls nach unserem Ritt durch dieses Chaos noch jemand brig ist?~
@1272 = ~Es werden viele brig sein, und sie werden dankbar fr jede Art Hilfe sein, um sich wieder ein normales Leben aufzubauen.~
@1273 = ~Und das, Solaufein, war jetzt wirklich das allerletzte mal, dass ich mit Euch ber meine Familie sprechen wollte.~
@1274 = ~Bisher fhlte ich mich ja vor gttlichen Interventionen relativ sicher, da ich keine so groe Angriffsflche geboten habe. Aber je mehr Spinnen wir in <CHARNAME>s Windschatten zerquetschen, umso mehr frage ich mich, ob Lolth nicht vielleicht doch gerade auf dieses Gottkind schaut... und auf die, die mit ihm reisen.~
@1275 = ~Kriegt Ihr doch noch Angst?~
@1276 = ~Nein, ich glaube nicht. Aber es ist immer ein zweischneidiges Schwert, sich mit Gttern anzulegen. Meine kleine Hoffnung ist, dass Lolth von ihrem ganzen zornigen Zhneknirschen gttliche Kopfschmerzen davontrgt.~
@1277 = ~Ihr glaubt noch immer, mehr Wert zu sein als ich, nicht wahr?~
@1278 = ~Was wart Ihr schon! Ein Drowkommandeur, und doch habt Ihr Euch herumschicken lassen wie ein Anfnger.~
@1279 = ~(schnaubt) Als ob Ihr nicht wsstet, dass ich keine Wahl hatte. Was wart Ihr, eine Tochter aus hohem Hause, und doch habt Ihr Euch vertreiben lassen!~
@1280 = ~(spricht drohend in der Sprache der Drow)~
@1281 = ~Oh, sicher, Viconia! (Auch Solaufein spricht Worte in Drow)~
@1282 = ~Wenn ich noch ein Wort in Drow hre, sitzt Ihr beide alleine am Straenrand!~
@1283 = ~Solaufein, Viconia! Hrt sofort auf, Euch zu streiten!~
@1284 = ~Die Unterhaltung ist mig, da Ihr beide nicht mehr zurck in Eure Gesellschaft knnt!~
@1285 = ~(Ihr lasst die beiden weitersprechen).~
@1286 = ~Ha! Hrt Ihr Euch eigentlich selbst zu, wenn Ihr sprecht?~
@1287 = ~Ja... Und was ich gerade hre, gefllt mir nicht.~
@1288 = ~(knurrt) <CHARNAME>, dieses Weibchen glaubt, mich mit ihren stndigen Blicken einschchtern zu knnen, und ihre herrische Art...~
@1289 = ~Ha, "herrische Art"! Nur, weil ich auf Euer Gejammer nicht wie <CHARNAME> mit wohlmeinendem Verstndnis reagiere?~
@1290 = ~Ihr meint, ich sollte mich in Eurer Gegenwart eigentlich wie zu hause fhlen?~
@1291 = ~Das tue ich, Viconia. Ihr erinnert mich an Ardulace und Imrae und wie die grausamen Drowweibchen alle hieen, die mir das Leben unertrglich gemacht haben!~
@1292 = ~Ich... ich bin nicht mehr so, Solaufein.~
@1293 = ~(schnaubt) Nein, in der Tat, das seid Ihr nicht. Es ist besser so, sonst htte <CHARNAME> Euch bereits gehutet.~
@1294 = ~Wir hatten auch einmal Avariel unter den Sklaven... Es war nett, sie beim Flattern anzusehen. Ein paar wurden die Flgel gestutzt, weil die Aufseher es Leid waren, sie einzufangen...~
@1295 = ~Es hat aber auch so keiner lange berlebt. Es dauerte nur ein paar Tage... Dann lagen sie tot am Boden. Sie vergingen einfach so, als die Hoffnungslosigkeit in der Dunkelheit sie aufgezehrt hatte.~
@1296 = ~Warum... warum erzhlt Ihr mir immer so grausame Dinge?~
@1297 = ~Weil es das ist, was ich war, Avariel. Grausam. Und weil es mich beeindruckt hat. Die menschlichen Sklaven leben lange Jahre selbst unter den widrigsten Bedingungen. Die Avariel verkmmerten in so kurzer Zeit. Ich sah nur ihre Schwche, Aerie. Ein Beweis fr die berlegenheit der Drow...~
@1298 = ~Doch Ihr verkrpert das, was meine Gttin mit dem Silberhaar als schtzenswert bezeichnet. Und ich hing in den letzten Wochen hufig genug mit meinem Leben von Euren Zaubern ab, um die Wahrheit in ihren Worten zu sehen, und die Verblendung meines grausamen Volkes zu entlarven.~
@1299 = ~Lasst Euch nicht von Hoffnungslosigkeit bermannen, Aerie. Ich... ich habe gesehen, wie schnell Ihr Avariel dadurch vergeht.~
@1300 = ~Viconia, ich sprach bisher zu scharf. Ich muss nicht nur Eure verbrannte Haut sehen, um zu wissen, dass Ihr anders seid als die dominanten Drowweibchen, die ich hinter mir gelassen habe.~
@1301 = ~Glaubt nicht, dass ich verweichlicht bin, Mnnchen! Ich schlage Euch noch immer mit Leichtigkeit!~
@1302 = ~(schnaubt) Das letzte Gift einer gezhmten Natter. Die Vehemenz, mit der Ihr dies verknden msst, spricht fr sich, Viconia. Die Frage ist, wer sich hier in <CHARNAME>s Schutz versteckt.~
@1303 = ~Vielleicht solltet Ihr mir ermunternde Dinge erzhlen, Solaufein, damit ich die Hoffnung nicht verliere, wenn dies Euer Wunsch ist. Und nicht immer diese Grausamkeiten...~
@1304 = ~Ich habe ber unser letztes Gesprch nachgedacht, Solaufein.~
@1305 = ~Allein die Tatsache, dass Ihr unter dem Schlechten leidet, das die Drow tun und getan haben, zeigt, dass Ihr anders seid.~
@1306 = ~Dass Ihr Euch selbst aber diese Vernderung nicht zugestehen wollt, zeigt eben dies: Dass Ihr darber reflektiert. Das zeigt, dass Ihr die Gebruche Eures Volkes hinter Euch gelassen und Euch verndert habt.~
@1307 = ~Es mag fr Euch befremdlich erscheinen, aber ich muss erst lernen, dass nicht jeder aus dem Anblick des Leids anderer ein Gefhl der berlegenheit zieht.~
@1308 = ~In der Tat! Ist es das, was Ihr tut? Eure Situation ber den Vergleich zum Unglck anderer aufzuwerten?~
@1309 = ~Nicht mehr... zumindest nicht mehr so, wie frher. Ihr msst bedenken, dass ich aus einer Gesellschaft komme, in der das Versagen des Einen den Erfolg des anderen bedeutet. Die Bestrafung des anderen hie die eigene Verschonung. Das Leid des anderen, egal wodurch verursacht, war meine heimliche Freude, denn sie brachte mich ein Stck weiter nach oben.~
@1310 = ~Nun bin ich hier, und sehe Euer Leid, doch es bringt mich nicht weiter. Ich kann keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen.~
@1311 = ~Im Gegenteil. Eure Verletzungen und die damit einhergehenden Einschrnkungen sind fr mich als Euer Kampfgefhrte sogar von Nachteil.~
@1312 = ~Weil... weil ich immer darber jammere?~
@1313 = ~Ich sehe den Schalk in Euren Augen, Aerie. Ihr traut mir viel zu, wenn Ihr meint, dass ich damit umgehen kann. Ihr scheint keine Angst vor dem Drow vor Euch zu haben. Es ist noch nicht allzu lange her, da htte ich Euch ohne zu zgern Eure Flgel ausgerissen, wenn die Umstnde es erfordet htten.~
@1314 = ~Allzu lange her ist es vielleicht nicht, aber wie Ihr selbst sagt: Es ist Vergangenheit.~
@1315 = ~Ihr scheint das klarer zu sehen als selbst ich es tue. Vor nicht allzu langer Zeit htte ich es Naivitt genannt und verchtlich die Nase germpft.~
@1316 = ~Vor nicht allzu langer Zeit httet Ihr keine Diskussionen dieses Inhalts mit mir gefhrt.~
@1317 = ~Das ist wahr, aber ich bin und bleibe nun einmal Drow. Und daher ist es...~
@1318 = ~Ich... ich frage mich, wer von uns beiden sich jetzt gerade an seinem alten Selbst festhlt... Drow.~
@1319 = ~Ihr meint, ich messe mit zweierlei Ma?... Da knntet Ihr Recht haben.~
@1320 = ~(schnaubt) Ja, nur bringen wird es mir nichts als einen frheren Tod.~
@1321 = ~Einen... einen frheren Tod als welchen? Den, den <CHARNAME> Euch in Ust Natha erspart hat? Oder den als Drinne?~
@1322 = ~Jetzt vermischt Ihr verschiedene Argumente. Ich sprach davon, dass ich noch schwcher und ein leichteres Ziel bin - durch die berlegungen ber Gut und Bse, die meine Entscheidungskraft mindern. Auch in Eurer Welt ist Schwche nicht immer eine Strke.~
@1323 = ~Aber manchmal muss eine Phase der Schwche durchgangen werden, um gestrkt hervorzugehen.~
@1324 = ~Wenn man diese Phase berlebt, Aerie. Wenn man sie berlebt.~
@1325 = ~Ihr seid nicht mehr im Unterreich, Solaufein. Ihr habt... habt Freunde, die Euch helfen.~
@1326 = ~Es ist nicht allzu lange her, da wre allein dies ein Grund fr mein Ende als Spinnenfra gewesen.~
@1327 = ~Aber ich verstehe, was Ihr meint. Habt Dank fr Eure freundlichen Worte.~
@1328 = ~Bring me Solaufein, the drow fighter who I saved from the drider cocoons.~
@1329 = ~<CHARNAME>! If it is you who summoned me here, then I can put away my weapons... I assume? What am I for you, in this place?~ [c#ablank]
@1330 = ~Solaufein, my friend! We spent time together on my travels. I need your help again.~
@1331 = ~I know we parted after I rescued you from the drider cocoons, but I do need you now.~
@1332 = ~Then I will accompany you, if you wish.~
@1333 = ~Yes, join me.~
@1334 = ~Not right now. You'll have to wait.~
@1335 = ~I will.~
@1336 = ~Then I'll wait. At least I won't get a sunburn in this place.~
@1337 = ~This spirit is full of the will to live. Rarely I have seen one cling to live as desperate, and effective, as this one.~
@1338 = ~Tell me about Solaufein.~
@1339 = ~Ah, Solaufein. The drow of neutral alignment, tainted in his own world for being too sympathetic, tainted in the surface world for belonging to an evil race. You freed him from a fate he himself calls worse than a painful death...~
@1340 = ~Now he is travelling with the chosen one, shaping destiny of all creatures below and above, to a measure he himself never would have considered possible.~
@1341 = ~(snort!) Shaping destiny, good man, but not the way I wanted it, or would you allege my doing to have any impact on saving the drow from their evilness? <CHARNAME>, let us go, before I start listening to this babbling and actually believing to have an imact on this world.~
@1342 = ~What a choice to make for a mortal! You need to be a god to understand *what* you are chosing. Until then, it's your own imagination and vanity that tipps the scales to either side.~
@1343 = ~With the power you reached, you already are the most godlike mortal I can imagine. Going there might not as big a step as it seems. Just remember that there is no way back. I will not forget your help, <CHARNAME>. I wish you well.~
@1344 = ~(schnaubt) Wisst Ihr, ich hatte mir groe Gedanken, ja geradezu Sorgen gemacht, ob meine Anwesenheit in Eurer Gruppe unverhltnismige feindliche Reaktionen der Oberflchler provozieren wrde.~ [c#ablank]
@1345 = ~Ich nehme nach dem Vorgefallenen zur Kenntnis, dass ich dazu gar nicht ntig bin. Ihr provoziert viel strkere Reaktionen, als es meine Anwesenheit je htte bewirken knnen.~
@1346 = ~Ihr meint den Vorfall an der Oase?~
@1347 = ~Wir tragen beide ein schwieriges Erbe, sozusagen. Meines ist jedoch von gttlicher Herkunft, also ist ein Schwerer-Wiegen durchaus angebracht.~
@1348 = ~Dass ich feindliche Reaktionen hervorrufe fllt Euch jetzt erst auf? Das geschieht doch die ganze Zeit!~
@1349 = ~Das ist alles, was Ihr dazu zu sagen habt? Wir mussten eine ganze Truppe Ritter umbringen!~
@1350 = ~Das ist alles, was Ihr dazu zu sagen habt? Wir htten beinahe eine ganze Truppe Ritter umbringen mssen!~
@1351 = ~Natrlich! Was sonst? Ich werde kaum die anderen Bhaalkinder meinen, die auf Euren Teil der Essenz aus sind.~
@1352 = ~Ihr sagt es, <CHARNAME>: Mssen. Aus der Berechtigung heraus, unser eigenes Leben zu verteidigen.~
@1353 = ~Einzelne Feinde, ja. Gegner, die sich Euch heraussuchen, ja. Monster, ja. Aber eine ganze Stadt, ein ganzes Land Eurer Mitmenschen in Vertretung durch einen Orden, das ist eine andere Dimension.~
@1354 = ~Euer Erbe sieht man Euch nicht an, im Gegensatz zu meinem. Vielleicht ist das der Grund, warum Eure Mitmenschen umso strker darauf reagieren, wenn sie davon erfahren?~
@1355 = ~Nehmt Ihr Euch etwa die Verbohrtheit dieser selbsternannten Rcher zu Herzen? Es ist nicht Euer Verschulden, dass sie in den Tod gegangen sind.~
@1356 = ~Macht Euch frei von dem Gedanken, dass Ihr die Geschicke einzelner Menschen lenken knntet. Ihr spielt mit dem Schicksal aller und werdet es beeinflussen. Aber Ihr habt trotzdem nicht die Macht, Einzelne von ihren Dummheiten abzuhalten, und das verlangt auch niemand.~
@1357 = ~Danke fr Euren Zuspruch.~
@1358 = ~Macht Euch keine Gedanken. Ich wei, dass mich kein Fehler trifft.~
@1359 = ~Das soll mich jetzt beruhigen?~
@1360 = ~Dies ist nur meine Sicht der Dinge.~
@1361 = ~Aber, um auf das Thema noch einmal zurck zu kommen...~
@1362 = ~Es ist nun vielmehr so, dass *ich* mir berlegen sollte, ob ich mich nicht durch Eure Nhe in Gefahr bringe.~
@1363 = ~Das tut Ihr sicherlich.~
@1364 = ~Solaufein, das ist doch nicht erst seit jetzt so. Es sollte Euch aufgefallen sein, dass ich kein normaler Oberweltler bin.~
@1365 = ~Und wenn?~
@1366 = ~Das stimmt. Ich hatte es auch bereits erwhnt, dass Ihr mir in dieser Beziehung etwas zu besonders seid.~
@1367 = ~Ich sage nicht, dass ich es in Erwgung ziehe. Zu viel verbindet mich mit Euch, und sei es nur mein durch Euer Vorbild erwecktes Pflichtbewusstsein, Euch aus Dank fr meine Rettung aus der Drinnenkammer bei Eurem Kampf beizustehen.~
@1368 = ~Wobei ich lieber unsere Freudschaft als Grund angeben wrde, wenn man mich fragt.~
@1369 = ~Aber es ist durchaus einen Gedanken wert, das msst Ihr doch zugeben? So ganz habe ich meinen Jahrhunderte langen Drill auf Abwgen der eigenen Vorteilsnahme nicht abgelegt, auch wenn ich nicht danach handele.~
@1370 = ~Und noch mehr Spinnen...~
@1371 = ~Falls irgendjemand sich die Frage gestellt haben sollte: Nein, ich fhle mich hier nicht wie zu Hause. Lasst uns dieses Getier tten und weiterziehen.~
@1372 = ~Let... me be, <CHARNAME>.~
@1373 = ~Hmph. What is it, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@1374 = ~You are very quiet lately...~
@1375 = ~Are you talking to me now?~
@1376 = ~Do you think I want something from you?~
@1377 = ~Solaufein, can I help you in any way?~
@1378 = ~Never mind.~
@1379 = ~Am I imagining things?~
@1380 = ~Don't talk to me like that!~
@1381 = ~I posed my question because of your glance towards me.~
@1382 = ~Do you miss my lamenting and whining about surface adversities?~
@1383 = ~What exactly is troubling you?~
@1384 = ~If you want to call it that. You are unusually surly.~
@1385 = ~What are you trying to hide behind your sarcasm, Solaufein?~
@1386 = ~You are asking me this directly? Is this a sign of... sympathy?~
@1387 = ~Yes, I guess it is. I like your words' symbolic gesture, <CHARNAME>, but there is nothing for me to tell you than what I already did.~
@1388 = ~Well, I guess I have to accept this answer.~
@1389 = ~Maybe I was wrong.~
@1390 = ~If you say so, solaufein.~
@1391 = ~Let me return to training my abilities, <CHARNAME>. It will serve you more than to poke me about my emotions!~
@1392 = ~The emotions you are confronted with are new to you,. I can help you with this.~
@1393 = ~You are behaving differently than before... more dismissive. It worries me to see this!~
@1394 = ~Hmph!~
@1395 = ~I'm trying to cope with my inadequacies since leaving the Underdark. If you don't know what I am referring to, then you didn't listen to much I was saying lately!~
@1396 = ~You mean compared to the charmer I was before?~
@1397 = ~What do you want?~ [c#ablank]
@1398 = ~(You raise your hand to remove a fluff out of Solaufein's hair.)~
@1399 = ~Would you die for me, Solaufein?~
@1400 = ~How could you secretely deny the drow culture and yet raise to such a high rank inside the Male Fighters' Society?~
@1401 = ~Did you have to pretend a lot to prevent your secret believes to be relvieled in Ust Natha?~
@1402 = ~When did you finally realize you are detesting drow traditions?~
@1403 = ~Did you have to make errands for Phaere all the time, Solaufein?~
@1404 = ~Solaufein, if one of us touches your arm to stress what he or she is talking about, how does it feel for you?~
@1405 = ~Solaufein, were there role models for your life? Drow who assisted and supported you, and helped you realize the cruelty of drow culture?~
@1406 = ~I guess you didn't expect to be taken to hell when joining me?~
@1407 = ~I have a question about something that happened in Ust Natha.~
@1408 = ~With the faked eggs you also worked towards the fall of house Despana. I am mentioning this because I have the impression this knowledge is important to you.~
@1409 = ~I can't get the thought about you and an offer about love services out of my mind, Solaufein...~
@1410 = ~You mentioned handmaidens of Lolth pursuing renegades. Do you expect an ambush at some point?~
@1411 = ~Are you sure you do not wish us to look for more followers of Eilistraee's?~
@1412 = ~You said your magic is nearly gone. But you still have magic abilities!~
@1413 = ~Tell me something about drow culture, Solaufein.~
@1414 = ~So, what is your impression about life on the surface so far, Solaufein?~
@1415 = ~Now you are still travelling with me...~
@1416 = ~Now you are travelling with me...~
@1417 = ~So... You left the Underdark to come to the surface with me, and all I drag you to is the darks of hell, as it seems.~
@1418 = ~Is there something on your mind?~
@1419 = ~Is the sun bothering you? Do you wish us to look for a shady spot and go on travelling tonight?~
@1420 = ~There will be many wary people in the cities. I expect you to wear a cape and hide your face as well as possible.~
@1421 = ~Solaufein, I do not wish to be bothered with your talking any more. You are in this group as a fighter, nothing more.~
@1422 = ~Nothing, Solaufein.~
@1423 = ~Ask.~
@1424 = ~What did you know about Irenicus' and Bodhi's machinations in the Underdark?~
@1425 = ~Why were you still in Ust Natha if most other fighters were busy preparing for the war on the surface?~
@1426 = ~Why did you expect me to rescue you from being turned into a drider?~
@1427 = ~About your being almost a drider...~
@1428 = ~I am so glad you told me about the hiding place of the rune stone to the drider chambers. I couldn't have rescued you otherwise!~
@1429 = ~You said you would have liked to see Phaere's face when she realized our betrayal. Did you really hate her that much?~
@1430 = ~Nothing.~
@1431 = ~What do you want to know?~
@1432 = ~Tell me about your goddess Eilistraee.~
@1433 = ~Hm, dancing for Eilistraee means naked in the moon light, as far as I know...~
@1434 = ~Why does Eilistraee like drow to dance naked, in your opinion?~
@1435 = ~What's up with driders?~
@1436 = ~Tell me about drow, Solaufein.~
@1437 = ~What do you think where all the evil, all the cruelty of your people came from, Solaufein?~
@1438 = ~Upon entering Ust Natha we witnessed a scene where a mother killed her son - saying 'sons I have enough, but where will I get a new well-trained slave from?'~
@1439 = ~I understood very well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1440 = ~(snort!) If you want to call my very personal game of revenge by this...~
@1441 = ~Was it meant as a compliment? Believe me, house Despana would have fallen no matter what after the demon didn't get the eggs. I understood quickly that you would see to this.~
@1442 = ~Do not think too highly about my aims in this matter, <CHARNAME>. Why, do you think, I had fake eggs made? But yes, it is true I gave them to you very willingly after realizing that you would be at the very place where I longed to be - to see Phaere fall.~
@1443 = ~Oh yes, ther were. Phaere, Ardulace, Imrae...~
@1444 = ~Oh, you didn't refer to them? But yes, <CHARNAME>. It were these drow who opened my eyes to the cruelty of my people. In case you were referring to a father like Drizzt had - no, there was no such role model for me.~
@1445 = ~Keep in mind my believes are the reult of centuries of revulsion and sullenness. Until then, I lived loyally to the dogmas of Lolth.~
@1446 = ~Well, I can only watch those we encounter until they see me clearly... After that their behavior is reclusive to hostile, the way I am used to. I can't blame them.~
@1447 = ~But I am travelling under your protection, which you granted me so far without hesitation.~
@1448 = ~Well, I guess it's the best I can expect.~
@1449 = ~So much life in your cities!~
@1450 = ~In Ust Natha all there was were drow, spiders, slaves, illithides... and spiders. No shouting othr than from angry handmaidens or high ranked females. No laughing. But cries of pain and agony.~
@1451 = ~I hear cries here, too, but it's the shouting of many individuals, used to proclaim their opinions. And there is just as much laughter, too.~
@1452 = ~Especially from the children. I... didn't know children laugh so much.~
@1453 = ~<CHARNAME>, ich habe nun diverse andere Stadtbewohner beobachten knnen. Manche waren ungeduldig miteinander, und mit ihren Kindern. Manche waren freundlich zueinander, geradezu zrtlich...~
@1454 = ~Ein Mann ksste seine Frau. Sie lchelte... Nur der offizielle Partner darf das, nicht wahr? Es war eine Geste der Zuneigung, aber auch der Besitzergreifung.~
@1455 = ~Ich... gestehe, dass mir diese Geste sehr viel besser gefllt als alles, was die Drow sich hierfr haben einfallen lassen.~
@1456 = ~Ich realisiere jetzt erst, dass es gar nicht stimmt, was ich sagte.~
@1457 = ~Ich hatte Freundlichkeit mit Weichheit und demnach mit einer gewissen Schwche gleichgesetzt. Erst jetzt sehe ich, dass das offene  Miteinander eine viel grere Strke erfordert.~
@1458 = ~Ihr Oberflchler sagt Eure Meinung, auch wenn sie den anderen brskieren knnte. Ihr steht dazu, auch wenn es fr einen anderen zurechtweisend ist. Dies erfordert Standkraft, Selbstbewusstsein und ein Selbstverstndnis, das man den Drow von klein auf austreibt.~
@1459 = ~Oh, aber Ihr seid nicht minder direkt, und durchaus nicht scheu, Eure Meinung zu sagen.~
@1460 = ~Ich wei nicht. Es gibt auch hier klare Hierarchien, die eingehalten werden mssen, weil sonst die eigene Unversehrtheit in Gefahr ist.~
@1461 = ~Geben die Drow denn nie Widerworte?~
@1462 = ~Was ist also Eure Schlussfolgerung?~
@1463 = ~Was genau meint Ihr mit Widerworten? Ein Drow wird sich hten, seiner Herrin zu widersprechen, wenn ihm seine Unversehrtheit lieb ist.~
@1464 = ~Wir Drow haben kein Problem damit, herrisch zu denen zu sprechen, denen wir uns berlegen whnen, und sind per Definition allen Oberflchlern berlegen! Das wre zumindest die Antwort, die Euch ein berzeugter Drow gbe, vermute ich.~
@1465 = ~Aber auch ich wei durchaus, wann ich mir Widerworte erlauben kann, und wann nicht. Ich war lange Zeit durch ein starkes Haus gesttzt, da gewhnt man sich einiges an. Auch bin ich nicht mehr der Jngste, und habe einiges erlebt, was meine Angst vor Repressalien geschmlert hat.~
@1466 = ~Vielleicht bin ich auch einfach so alt, dass mich der Altersschwachsinn gepackt hat, wie es bei manchen Mnnchen geschieht, wenn sie denn so lange berleben. Es gab einige wenige, die tun und sagen konnten, was sie wollten, ohne dass sie belangt wurden, da sie keine Gefahr mehr darstellten.~
@1467 = ~Kuschen vor der Obrigkeit, Einschchterung und Lgen habe ich auch hier zur Genge gesehen, natrlich. Aber im Groen und Ganzen stimmt das, was ich sagte.~
@1468 = ~Die Drow mgen als Rasse stark sein, und durch gnadenlose Brutalitt Angst und Schrecken verbreiten. Aber als einzelnes Individuum genommen zeigt Ihr eine viel grere Strke.~
@1469 = ~Im Unterreich konnte ich in der Dunkelheit die Wrmeschattierung der Felsen sehen und mich darin verstecken. Hier an der Oberflche im Licht der Sonne ist alles nur hei, hei, hei!~
@1470 = ~Ich habe die Blicke gesehen, mit denen mich die anderen ansehen.~
@1471 = ~Ich werde unter Oberflchlern kein Vertrauen finden.~
@1472 = ~Ich sehe Euch nicht so an, Solaufein.~
@1473 = ~Vielleicht, vielleicht auch nicht.~
@1474 = ~Pfft. Das schliet Ihr daraus, dass sich Fremde gegenber einem unbekannten Drow verschlossen geben? Verlangt Ihr nicht vielleicht ein bisschen viel?~
@1475 = ~Ich wei, dass ich Euer Vertrauen habe, und es ehrt mich sehr. Doch werden Fremde mir je anders als misstrauisch begegnen?~
@1476 = ~Das ist wahr, und Ihr zeigt ein gewisses Interesse an meinen Belangen.~
@1477 = ~Das sagt Ihr, doch Euer Umgang mit mir ist geprgt von Euren Vorurteilen gegenber Drow.~
@1478 = ~Ihr habt mich als Begleiter akzeptiert. Vielleicht werde ich doch Vertrauen finden, aber es wird sehr lange dauern.~
@1479 = ~Die Frage ist, ob ein Menschenleben ausreicht, um diese Zeit aufzubringen. Und selbst die lange Lebenszeit der Elfen knnte nicht ausreichen, um das tiefe Misstrauen zu berwinden.~
@1480 = ~Das Misstrauen der Oberflcher oder Eures?~
@1481 = ~Ihr habt Euch einen beschwerlichen Weg gewhlt. Aber es knnte trotzdem der erfllendere sein.~
@1482 = ~(schnaubt) Ihr versteht das Problem.~
@1483 = ~Es wird sich zeigen, wie es weitergeht.~
@1484 = ~Ich kann mich nicht sattsehen an den Familien, die ich in Euren Stdten zusammen gehen sehe, <CHARNAME>. Es wird mir immer ein Geheimnis bleiben, wie das Leben in enger Vertrautheit mit den leiblichen Eltern aussieht.~
@1485 = ~Ja, eine intakte Familie ist etwas Schnes.~
@1486 = ~Auch hier werden genug Kinder geqult und schlecht behandelt.~
@1487 = ~Es ist nicht alles Gold, was glnzt.~
@1488 = ~Es ist keinesfalls fr alle die Normalitt, mit beiden Eltern aufzuwachsen.~
@1489 = ~Ich kann Euch hierzu allerdings aus meiner Erfahrung auch nur wenig zeigen, Solaufein.~
@1490 = ~Sicher. Und doch wird es mehr geben, die behtet und geliebt aufwachsen.~
@1491 = ~Ich bin nicht naiv. Ich wei, dass ein bestrkendes Umfeld der Idealfall wre. Auch hier muss der Einzelne lernen, sich gegen andere zu behaupten und seine Interessen durchzusetzen, ohne Zweifel. Jede Familie wird ihre eigene Methode haben, dies ihren Kindern zu vermitteln.~
@1492 = ~Na, aufgrund meines gttlichen Vaters... Ich denke, das macht mich doch sehr speziell.~
@1493 = ~Ich bin ein Findelkind und wurde von einem Pflegevater aufgezogen.~
@1494 = ~Ich hatte keine Familie, Solaufein. Mein Vater ist ein toter Gott, und meine Mutter hat mich vermutlich nicht freiwillig empfangen, und kennen tue ich sie auch nicht.~
@1495 = ~Ich hatte keine Familie, Solaufein. Mein Vater ist ein toter Gott, und meine Mutter... Nun, die kannte ich auch nicht.~
@1496 = ~Sowohl meine Eltern als auch mein Pflegevater sind alle tot.~
@1497 = ~Und doch wird es hier prozentual mehr Familien geben, in denen die Eltern selbst ihre Kinder aufziehen, als welche, in denen es nicht der Fall ist.~
@1498 = ~So betrachtet habt Ihr wohl Recht, dass Ihr keine Familie hattet, wie sie bei Euch blich ist. Doch Eure Geschichte zeigt mir mehr, als Ihr zu realisieren scheint. Immerhin *wurdet* Ihr aufgenommen.~
@1499 = ~Findelkinder bei den Drow gibt es nicht, obwohl unsere Aufzucht durch die Haussippen dafr mehr als geeignet wre. Aber wen kein Haus schtzt, der landet schnell als Spinnenfutter. Die Mnnchen noch eher als die Weibchen. Die Tchter tten sich dafr in ihrem Bestreben nach Macht spter gegenseitig.~
@1500 = ~Ihr habt Recht. Ich hatte ein Zuhause.~
@1501 = ~Macht Euch doch nichts vor. Gorion nahm mich auf, weil ich das Bhaalerbe in mir trage.~
@1502 = ~Als normales Kind htte ich diese Chance nicht gehabt.~
@1503 = ~Nein, das reicht mir nicht. Ich bin sicher, dass es immer Findelkinder geben wird, die aus anderen Grnden als Nchstenliebe aufgezogen werden.~
@1504 = ~Wisst Ihr das? Als normales Kind wrt Ihr vielleicht in eine normale Familie hineingeboren worden.~
@1505 = ~Da mgt Ihr Recht haben. Ein Bhaalkind htte vielleicht auch bei den Drow besondere Aufmerksamkeit erhalten, aber es wre nur zum Vorteil einer Mutter Oberin gewesen, und so lange, wie es und sein Erbe von Nutzen gewesen wren.~
@1506 = ~Und doch kann er viele Grnde haben, die nicht Barmherzigkeit heien, ohne, dass seine Motivation die eigene Vorteilsnahme war.~
@1507 = ~Aus meiner Sicht hattet Ihr mehr Familie, als ich es mir als Drow jemals htte ertrumen knnen, junger <PRO_RACE>.~
@1508 = ~My magic *has* diminished.~
@1509 = ~You can still do dimension door!~
@1510 = ~You still can bring darkness to the enemy.~
@1511 = ~You can still cause Faery Fire!~
@1512 = ~You still can dispell magic!~
@1513 = ~It must have been impressive to see you fight with your full magic.~
@1514 = ~I never saw you use so powerful magic when we both worked for Phaere.~
@1515 = ~So you say.~
@1516 = ~(snort!) Yes. Once per day. And only as far as my visual range goes. If it wouldn't be so pathetic I could even laugh about it.~
@1517 = ~You call that darkness? I call that dusk. I could inflict darkness upon others so they would not only loose sight but also hearing - their complete orientation! They were *breathing* darkness, <CHARNAME>.~
@1518 = ~Now I call myself lucky if I manage to give the enemy as much blindness as I encounter in your sun myself.~
@1519 = ~I am delighted you even notice the pathetic light I create with this. Maybe it is due to the brightness of your surface world, but I have the impression my fire turned into sparks, the most.~
@1520 = ~Yes. That is the only one that still works as it did before, but I have to focus my whole magic onto it. There were times before when I could draw from nearly endless ressources.~
@1521 = ~Probably, considering I would have fought you as an enemy of the drow, had we meet differently.~
@1522 = ~Because there was no opportunity. Where should I have used it? Against snirflebi? Against devourers? The former are not worth the trouble, and the latter immune to most of it.~
@1523 = ~Unsere Gesellschaft ist in 'Huser' organisiert, jedes gefhrt von einer Mutter Oberin. Die Weibchen haben die Macht. Die Mnnchen sind dazu da, die mchtigen Weibchen zu erfreuen, und fr sie zu kmpfen.~
@1524 = ~Wir sind bse und machtbesessen und tten oder versklaven alle Wesen anderer Rassen, wenn wir knnen.~
@1525 = ~Die Weibchen schmieden ihre Rnke und bringen sich gegenseitig um. Die Mnnchen dienen den Weibchen und werden von ihnen umgebracht, wenn sie deren Unwillen erregen.~
@1526 = ~Mehr gibt es nicht zu sagen.~
@1527 = ~Familien, wie Ihr sie kennt, gibt es bei uns nicht. Die mchtigen Weibchen nehmen sich die Mnnchen ihrer Gunst, um mit ihnen Kinder zu zeugen. Die Kinder eines Hauses werden von den lteren Geschwistern aufgezogen... Und die Shne sind fr ihre Mtter nicht bedeutender als Sklaven. Wir sind Eigentum der Mutter Oberin, und sie entscheidet ber unser Schicksal.~
@1528 = ~Schmerz, Strafen, Folter und Tod sind unsere stndigen Begleiter, <CHARNAME>. Die Zofen Lolths sind Meisterinnen darin. Die Weibchen mgen mehr Macht haben, aber schlussendlich sind sie diesem Spiel genauso unterworfen, wie die Mnnchen.~
@1529 = ~Es ist die Spinnenknigin, <CHARNAME>. Lolth ist bse und machtbesessen. Sie ist immerzu hungrig nach Opfern und unersttlich in ihrer Grausamkeit.~
@1530 = ~Aber die Drow selber sind bse. Nicht ohne Grund hlt die Spinnengttin die Macht ber uns. Wir sind vom rechten Weg abgekommen. Kein Wunder, dass sich einige Drow an andere Gtter wenden... Wenn auch meist im Stillen, denn Lolth ist unberechenbar in ihrem Zorn.~
@1531 = ~Drinnen entstehen durch das Verschmelzen einer Spinne und eines Drow. Sie werden zur Ehre Lolths geschaffen und fristen danach ein gechtetes Leben.~
@1532 = ~Es ist... die allerletzte Strafe, <CHARNAME>. Das grausamste, was einem in Lolths Namen angetan werden kann. Selbst das langsame Zerfleischtwerden als lebendiges Spinnenfutter ist gndig dagegen.~
@1533 = ~Ich... ich kann nicht in Worte fassen, was es fr mich bedeutet, dass Ihr mir dieses Schicksal erspart habt. Eure Gnade in Ust Natha, mich nicht zu tten, war bemerkenswert. Aber sie war nichts gegen Eure Barmherzigkeit, mir das Schicksal einer Drinne zu ersparen!~
@1534 = ~Eilistraee ist die Tochter von Lolth und Corellon Larethian und die Schwester von Vhaeraun. Um das Bse der Dunkelelfen auszugleichen, verbannte sie sich selber aus dem Kreis der Elfengtter.~
@1535 = ~Sie leitet ihre Anhnger an, jedem zu helfen. Sie ist auerdem erfreut von Musik und Tanz, aber nicht die Art, wie es in Ust-Natha blich war.~
@1536 = ~Fr die zu kmpfen, die es nicht fr sich selber tun knnen, <CHARNAME>, wie sehr luft dies den Gebruchen der Dunkelelfen entgegen! Ich bin sehr froh, ihr nun in dieser Hinsicht besser dienen zu knnen. Ich werde mich bemhen, es ihren Lehren Recht zu machen.~
@1537 = ~Heit das, beim nchsten Mondschein werdet Ihr unbekleidet durch die Wlder streifen?~
@1538 = ~Danke fr die Information, Solaufein.~
@1539 = ~Jaja, aber passt auf, dass Ihr es nicht bertreibt!~
@1540 = ~Das meinte ich nicht.~
@1541 = ~Wie ich bereits sagte, <CHARNAME>, die Musik und die Tnze aus Ust Natha wren nicht sehr... angebracht. Ich bin begierig, zu erfahren, wie meine Glaubensgenossen Eilistraee huldigen.~
@1542 = ~Ich halte es fr unwahrscheinlich, dass mir jemand aus Ust Natha hinterhergeschickt werden wird. Es ist eher wahrscheinlich, dass ich einen spontanen Angriff provoziere, wenn mich Diener der Spinnengttin bemerken. Dieser wird sich nicht von den der Monstern unterscheiden, die wir sonst so bekmpfen.~
@1543 = ~(schnaubt) Falls Ihr Bedenken habt, be ich meine Reflexe und Vorsicht einfach an den feindlichen Oberflchenbewohnern, bis mich Anhnger der Spinnengttin aufstbern.~
@1544 = ~(schnaubt) Dass Ihr diesen Teil Eures vterlichen Erbes ausleben knntet, hatte ich in der Tat nicht in Betracht gezogen.~
@1545 = ~Es mag ein Zufall sein, dass Euer Feind uns mitgezogen hat... Aber eigentlich ist es der einzig logische Ort fr ein Bhaalkind ohne Seele, findet Ihr nicht?~
@1546 = ~Es... war meine Hoffnung, dass sich mein Eindruck von Euch nicht tuscht. Ihr hattet bereits in Ust Natha mein Leben verschont und ein gewisses Interesse an mir gezeigt...~
@1547 = ~(schnaubt) Bevor Ihr Euch jetzt zu viel darauf einbildet: Und Ihr wart meine einzige Chance, also habe ich sie genutzt.~
@1548 = ~Ja?~
@1549 = ~Der Gedanke, dass Ihr zu einer Drinne verwandelt werden knntet, lsst mich schaudern. Ich htte alles gegeben, um Euch zu retten!~
@1550 = ~Ich sah es als meine Pflicht an, nachdem Ihr in meiner Gegenwart gefangen genommen wurdet.~
@1551 = ~Nichts weiter. Macht es einfach nicht noch einmal.~
@1552 = ~(schnaubt) Nicht, wenn ich es verhindern kann!~
@1553 = ~Wenn ich es nicht besser wsste, wrde ich sagen, Ihr leidet an Verblendung. Aber ich danke Euch fr meine Rettung, mein Freund.~ ~Wenn ich es nicht besser wsste, wrde ich sagen, Ihr leidet an Verblendung. Aber ich danke Euch fr meine Rettung, meine Freundin.~
@1554 = ~Ich bin froh, dass Ihr es verstanden hattet.~
@1555 = ~Und ich bin sehr froh, dass die vermaledeite Imrae ihre Jagd so wichtig nahm, dass sie meinen Worten offensichtlich keinerlei Beachtung geschenkt hat!~
@1556 = ~Alles? Um einen Fremden zu retten? Einen Drow?~
@1557 = ~Pflicht? Einen Fremden zu retten, einen Drow?~
@1558 = ~Ihr meint, nachdem Ihr mich bereits in Ust Natha gekostet habt?~
@1559 = ~M-Hm... Genau danach.~
@1560 = ~Schweigt darber, bitte.~
@1561 = ~Es tut mir Leid, dass ich Euch in Ust Natha in die Freudengemcher gezwungen habe, Solaufein.~
@1562 = ~Ich... habe dort eine Rolle gespielt, um nicht aufzufallen.~
@1563 = ~Die Erinnerung daran reicht. Wie kommt Ihr auf die Idee, dass ich es noch einmal wollen wrde?~
@1564 = ~Vielleicht sollten wir nicht weiter ber dieses Thema sprechen.~
@1565 = ~Ihr meint, nachdem Ihr mich bereits in Ust Natha verschont habt?~
@1566 = ~Es tut mir Leid, dass ich Euch in Ust Natha in die Lustgemcher gezwungen habe, Solaufein.~
@1567 = ~Nachdem ich Euch bereits in Ust Natha schlussendlich verweigert habe, meint Ihr.~
@1568 = ~Eine Wiederholung wird es nicht geben.~
@1569 = ~Euch ist das Thema unangenehm?~
@1570 = ~Ihr wart als Drow verkleidet und musstet sicherstellen, dass Ihr nicht entdeckt werdet.~
@1571 = ~Httet Ihr mich zarter angefasst, htte ich vieleicht Eure Maskerade durchschaut.~
@1572 = ~Httet Ihr nicht nach mir gefragt, htte ich Euch vielleicht trotzdem zu Diensten sein mssen, wer wei das schon.~
@1573 = ~Es ist Vergangenheit, ebenso wie alles andere, was ich dort unten erlebt habe.~
@1574 = ~Danke, dass Ihr es so seht.~
@1575 = ~Ich... war jedenfalls beeindruckt. Das knnt Ihr mir glauben.~
@1576 = ~Euer Widerwillen war deutlich zu spren, und es hat mir ebenfalls die Laune verdorben.~
@1577 = ~Ich bin froh, dass es so ausgegangen ist.~
@1578 = ~Ist mir recht.~
@1579 = ~Nun gut, lassen wir das Thema.~
@1580 = ~In Ust Natha fordertet Ihr einen Dienst von einem Drow an einem Drow.~
@1581 = ~An was ich letzthin dachte wren besser auf Euch Oberweltler zugeschnittene Dienste gewesen...~
@1582 = ~(schnaubt) Das wollt Ihr nicht wirklich, <CHARNAME>. Nicht von mir.~
@1583 = ~Habt Ihr es wirklich in Betracht gezogen?~
@1584 = ~Und... So als Experiment, ob ich als Oberweltler beeindruckt wre?...~
@1585 = ~Warum seid Ihr so sicher, dass ich es nicht wollen wrde?~
@1586 = ~Das werde ich auch hoffen. Ich habe keinerlei Bedrfnis danach.~
@1587 = ~In der Tat. Schlagt soetwas nie vor, wenn wir weiterhin Freunde bleiben sollen.~
@1588 = ~Was fr eine Idee, dass Ihr mich ganz sicher damit beeindrucken knntet. Ich habe schlielich Phaere bedient, ohne dass sie Verdacht schpfte. So viel schlechter kann ich nicht gewesen sein!~
@1589 = ~Nein. Als ich zu der Schlussfolgerung kam, dass dies das Einzige ist, was mir als Mglichkeit einfllt, habe ich mich entschlossen, mit Euch zu sprechen.~
@1590 = ~Wenn es tatschlich dazu gekommen wre, wre es ein Dienst gewesen, <CHARNAME>, nichts weiter. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob Ihr das wollt.~
@1591 = ~Seid Ihr gar nicht neugierig darauf, wie es mit mir wre?~
@1592 = ~Und... Nicht als Dienst, sondern als Ausdruck von Wertschtzung und Zuneigung? Und, hem, ehrlicher Begierde?~
@1593 = ~Ich will es auch nicht. Ich frage nur, warum es fr Euch so gar nicht in Betracht kommt.~
@1594 = ~Und was, wenn ich Euch sage, dass ich sicher bin, es zu wollen?~
@1595 = ~Lehren?! (schnaubt) Wie wahr. Ihr httet als der junge <PRO_RACE>, der Ihr seid, noch genug Jahre fr die ntige Demtigung und Pein zur Verfgung.~
@1596 = ~Seid nicht albern. Ihr wollt dies nicht als Profession lernen, <CHARNAME>. Nicht die Grausamkeiten, die die Drow gelehrt bekommen. Und das ist alles, was ich Euch lehren knnte.~
@1597 = ~Grausamkeiten? Das zu hren entsetzt mich. Es ist das Gegenteil dessen, was ich mit krperlicher Liebe verbinde, Solaufein.~
@1598 = ~Das klingt eher, als msste ich Euch etwas beibringen - dringend!~
@1599 = ~Naja, das mit dem Lehren war vielleicht keine gute Idee. Aber ansonsten...?~
@1600 = ~Wisst Ihr, wie jung Ihr im Vergleich zu mir seid, <CHARNAME>?~
@1601 = ~Ist das ein Problem?~
@1602 = ~Nein, weil Ihr mir nicht Euer genaues Alter nennt.~
@1603 = ~Umso mehr knntet Ihr mich lehren.~
@1604 = ~Vielleicht habe ich auch hier einen Bedarf, die Gebruche der Drow mit Angenehmem zu ersetzen. Doch falls dies so ist, dann habe ich kein Verlangen, dass Ihr hierzu mein Lehrmeister seid.~
@1605 = ~And oh, females and higher ranked males enjoy themselves indeed. It is not torture for everyone involved...~
@1606 = ~You were a higher ranked male yourself, Solaufein?...~
@1607 = ~Not my whole life, <CHARNAME>...~
@1608 = ~And after becoming one, I was cursed with enough empathy not to make others do what I hated giving myself.~
@1609 = ~My longing for physical intimacies is very little, <CHARNAME>. And if, then I am old enough not to ask them from a fledgling such as you.~
@1610 = ~You are too young, young <PRO_RACE>. Ask me again after 300 years passed.~
@1611 = ~Ha, I'll be dead longer than alive after that time span!~
@1612 = ~Oh, you are into necrophilia?~
@1613 = ~Very funny, Solaufein.~
@1614 = ~Let me think... you think I'll like getting intimate with a dodderer then?~
@1615 = ~Ic ould meet the wrong person and be spoiled and traumatised. Aren't you the least afraid, don't you feel just a tiny little bit responsible to save me from such a fate? (eye lash flutter)~
@1616 = ~I don't want it either, Solaufein.~
@1617 = ~(snort!) I am such a person, <CHARNAME>, believe me. No, I do not feel responsible, even though I don't think you were asking in earnest.~
@1618 = ~(The corner of Solaufein's mouth twitches briefly.)~
@1619 = ~I see you understood.~
@1620 = ~Ich sage es nur, weil ich aus einer Kultur komme, die es vorsieht, dass die Untergebenen ihre Anfhrer auf diese Art erfreuen, <CHARNAME>. Ich richte mich nach Euren Anweisungen, also seid Ihr mein Anfhrer.~ ~Ich sage es nur, weil ich aus einer Kultur komme, die es vorsieht, dass die Untergebenen ihre Anfhrer auf diese Art erfreuen, <CHARNAME>. Ich richte mich nach Euren Anweisungen, also seid Ihr meine Anfhrerin.~
@1621 = ~Aber ich bin nicht Euer untergebenes Mnnchen, sondern Euer Freund. Ich bin freiwillig hier. Wir sind ebenbrtig.~
@1622 = ~Und als Freund steht es mir zu, Euch diesen Dienst nicht zu leisten.~
@1623 = ~Das trifft sich gut.~
@1624 = ~Phaere war in vielerlei Hinsicht erstaunlich blind in Bezug auf Euch. Aber, ja, Ihr habt Recht, natrlich.~
@1625 = ~Wie ich bereits sagte, habe ich es nie ernsthaft in Betracht gezogen, mich Euch so zu nhern. Ich erkannte in dem Moment, in dem ich den Gedanken hatte, dass er mich meinem Ziel nicht nherbringen wrde, um es vorsichtig auszudrcken.~
@1626 = ~Es ist, wie ich sagte. Die Begegnung mit Drizzt hat mir genug zum Nachdenken gegeben. Es schadet sicher auch nicht, mich erst besser mit der Oberflche vertraut zu machen, bevor ich Gleichgesinnten gegenbertrete.~
@1627 = ~Ich habe auerdem verstanden, dass wir Eure Seele wiederholen mssen.~
@1628 = ~Ich habe auerdem verstanden, dass wir erst Euren Kampf gegen die Bhaalkinder ausfechten mssen.~
@1629 = ~Fr Euer Wohl, aber auch fr das aller anderen, die sich in Eurer Nhe befinden.~
@1630 = ~Yes, I heard that, too.~
@1631 = ~So, are you going to do it?~
@1632 = ~I don't have the impression there is much moon light around currently, <CHARNAME>.~
@1633 = ~Not necessarily now, you know. There will be, eventually.~
@1634 = ~Of course not! You misinterpreted my words intentionally, I am sure.~
@1635 = ~If you say so.~
@1636 = ~Why should I do that, alone? And while keeping you waiting?~
@1637 = ~Does it matter, if it is for the glory of your goddess?~
@1638 = ~So, no dancing for the praise of your goddess?~
@1639 = ~Thank goodness. I would part with you, would I see you doing anything so foolish.~
@1640 = ~Maybe she wants us to be defenseless. Defenseless and native, like innocent children.~
@1641 = ~I didn't lose hope to overcome the cruelty of my people with reason, though. As much as I worship her and honor her dogmas, I am not old enough to behave like a child.~
@1642 = ~I have Eilisreaee's song in my heart, and that has to suffice until I meet other followers. I do not feel safe enough yet, <CHARNAME>, to strip all my armour and weapons.~
@1643 = ~You strip, and I'll watch your back. (Ahem)...~
@1644 = ~We could dance together... naked.~
@1645 = ~Oh, but you could strip your clothes and dance *with* the weapons. (giggle)~
@1646 = ~You don't feel safe with me?~
@1647 = ~You would watch over one of your fighters dancing naked through the moon light? You are weirder than I thought.~
@1648 = ~Then neither of us would be prepared for an attack, <CHARNAME>.~
@1649 = ~Now you sound like a paladin.~
@1650 = ~You are taking me too seriously!~
@1651 = ~Indeed.~
@1652 = ~Not a paladin, but a highly unsettled Drow.~
@1653 = ~I do not mind nudity. I do not mind nudity in front of others, either. But I do mind being unarmed. That is why I think dancing through the moon light alone is rather unfortunate, and should be done in a group of fellow believers, at the least.~
@1654 = ~(Flutter your eyelashes) What a pity. I'd enjoy seeing you dancing naked.~
@1655 = ~(snort!) You will be spared to watch me performing this act of self-discovery in the near future, <CHARNAME>.~
@1656 = ~Isn't it obvious? She gave me every reason to in the last two hundred years. The handmaidens' tentacle rods drove Phaere's feelings for me out just as they did mine for her.~
@1657 = ~I don't believe you if you say you hated her.~
@1658 = ~Didn't you feel sorry for her at all?~
@1659 = ~Do you feel guilty? For not being able to protect her from it, I mean.~
@1660 = ~But wouldn't you love her still, if coincidences wouldn't have been so cruel?~
@1661 = ~Very well, if you say so.~
@1662 = ~I felt sorry about the situation we were in, <CHARNAME>. I was sorry it shouldn't be able for drow to live the way Phaere and I did for a short time.~
@1663 = ~But Phaere... With all sympathy for what was done to her, I understood very well that afterwards, she saw me as a reminder of her flaw, a sign of her weakness and would have preferred for me to vanish sooner than later.~
@1664 = ~Call it as you wish. Detest her, be disgusted by her, trying to avoid her, whatever! It was the intimateness that defined our connection, and nothing of it was left. I didn't love her any more. I'm not a masochist!~
@1665 = ~Protect her... How was I supposed to spear her this fate? The only thing we could have done was trying to run away into the unknown.~
@1666 = ~Do not think this was an option for Phaere! Or for me, for that matter. It was a game we were both fascinated by, and it worked due to Phaere's high rank as a first daughter. We both profited by it. She called a strong and loyal fighter her own, and I had the favor of a high female.~
@1667 = ~Both our ranks and the advantages coming with them would have been without value if running away. We weren't ready to leave the possibilities offered to us behind. Would we have escaped, I guess we would have found a reason to kill each other soon after!~
@1668 = ~All Phaere had left was her ambition. She never had a good judgement, though. She ever only saw her goals and used every possibility she saw for them, and this didn't change for the better afterwards. On the contrary, now she became deeply absorbed in her ideas and couldn't be dissuaded from them unless something very contradictory happened. You remember what we had to free her from at your first meeting with her?...~
@1669 = ~I explained to me that this was the reason why she got so focussed onto you. A foreign group, presumably from Ched Nassad... and you were with her, at the conjuration ceremony! It takes some ignorance to hand that much power to a group of foreign drow, no matter how young and compliant.~
@1670 = ~But the daughter is a chip off the old block, as you surfacers say. Ardulace permitted your presence in the temple. Seems she was blinded by her own arrogance and Phaere's blindness both.~
@1671 = ~But it came as it was supposed to. Stubborn as Phaere was she put all her efforts into you, being so nicely available in the times of war preparation. And it came as I always expected: She tripped over her own arrogance.~
@1672 = ~(sigh) But that is past, now. Let us continue.~
@1673 = ~If the handmayden of Lolth would not have ended our affair, it would have ended differently, and probably to a less comfortable way, <CHARNAME>.~
@1674 = ~Believe me when I say: If there would have been any other ending to Phaere's and my connection, it would have included spiders, driders, and probably death. I don't expect you to understand, but the way it ended was fortunate, for me. Considered the drow society I lived in, and being the male I am, for my survival and my position in my house it was more than fortunate this affair was ended the way it was. Even with the tortures I had to endure over the last centuries. Because I am alive.~
@1675 = ~You didn't answer my question, Solaufein.~
@1676 = ~In a way I did, <CHARNAME>. I answered your question by pointing out that it doesn't stand against the details of reality. But since you insist, I will answer: I do not know what I would have felt for Pheare, had our connection not be discovered by her house.~
@1677 = ~Maybe we would be lovers still. Maybe we would hate each other just the like. Maybe one of us would have killed the other, to mute a potential thread or get rid of a dangerous insider.~
@1678 = ~But with highest probability we would both be dead, betrayed by one of our brothers and sisters, taking advantage of our secret and the vulnerability that comes along with it.~
@1679 = ~Ich wusste, dass die Mutter Oberin Ardulace einen Verbndeten hatte, von dem sie sich Hilfe in ihrem Krieg gegen die Elfen versprach. Ich wusste aber weder seinen Namen, noch habe ich ihn zu Gesicht bekommen.~
@1680 = ~Glaubt nicht, dass das Haus Despana mich in seine Machenschaften eingeweiht htte. (schnaubt) Nun, als Kommandeur der Kmpfergilde war ich selbstverstndlich in die Kriegsvorbereitungen eingebunden, aber glaubt nicht, sie htten mich in ihre geheimen Plne eingeweiht!~
@1681 = ~Hm. Ist es nicht genau anders herum gewesen? Nur *weil* ich eine solch hohe Stellung inne hatte, habe ich eine innere Ablehnung und Gefhle der Abscheu entwickeln knnen, ohne dass ich ihnen zum Opfer gefallen bin. Als niederes Mnnchen htte mir eine solche Einstellung den Tod gebracht - oder die Drinnenkammern.~
@1682 = ~Ihr msst verstehen: Als heimlicher Anhnger Eilistraees, der die Gebruche der Drow verachtet, htte ich sonst niemals so lange berleben knnen. Ich wre entweder aufgeflogen oder wahnsinnig geworden.~
@1683 = ~Nein. Ich habe mich nicht verbogen, <CHARNAME>. Im Gegenteil, ich habe mich in meine Aufgabe verbissen, denn ich musste mich an etwas festhalten, um die Diskrepanz ertragen zu knnen.~
@1684 = ~Ich habe mich in meine Pflichten als mnnlicher Kmpfer verbissen, weil es die einzige Mglichkeit war, mein Gefhl der Unzufriedenheit zu verdrngen. Nur selten, wenn mich die Abscheu ber das, was mir tglich begegnete, zu gro wurde, kam es nach oben, und ich habe mich nach meiner Dame Eilistraee mit dem Silberhaar gesehnt.~
@1685 = ~Dann habe ich das Gefhl wieder mit meinem Eifer erstickt. Ich wre sonst irre geworden, <CHARNAME>.~
@1686 = ~Ihr vermutet vielleicht, dass es in dem Moment war, als die Zofen Lolths Phaere wegzogen, um sie mit den Tentakelruten zu maltrtieren. Dies war ein einschneidendes Erlebnis, denn Phaere war bis dahin meine Mglichkeit gewesen, den alltglichen Grausamkeiten zu entfliehen.~
@1687 = ~Aber ich war damals noch zu sehr in den Gebruchen meines Volkes verankert. Ich suchte mir eine andere Mglichkeit, meine Gedanken zu beruhigen, verbiss mich in mein Kmpfersein und nhrte meine Sehnsucht nach Eilistraee.~
@1688 = ~Alles, was danach geschah, waren Tropfen, die den Stein weiter hhlten. In mir reifte meine Unzufriedenheit... und als Ihr vor mir standet in der Gilde der mnnlichen Kmpfer und mein Leben verschontet, da endlich verstand ich, dass ich mich von meinem Volk und seinen Verblendungen abwenden konnte. Es war nicht nur die Tatsache, dass mein Leben verwirkt war und ich mich verstecken musste. Es war auch endlich die Erkenntnis, dass ich mich von den bsen Gebruchen meines Volkes abwenden *wollte*.~
@1689 = ~(schnaubt) Das htte sie wohl gerne gehabt. Nicht die ganze Zeit, zum Glck. Ich hatte sogar eine Weile Ruhe vor ihr, bevor Ardulaces grenwahnsinnige Plne die verfgbaren Kmpfer verknappten.~
@1690 = ~Wre die Stadt nicht so knapp an Kmpfern gewesen, htte ich vielleicht nicht mit Euch Phaere befreien mssen. Nun, das hat diese dann wohl wieder auf den Geschmack gebracht, mich herumzuschubsen. Vielleicht lag es aber auch daran, dass ihre sonstigen Lieblinge mit Kriegsvorbereitungen beschftigt waren.~
@1691 = ~Aber vielleicht sollte ich ihr in gewisser Weise dankbar sein. Selbst... selbst die Schikanen Phaeres ber die Jahre waren gut, um mich abzulenken. Darauf konnte ich meine ganzen Gefhle des Abscheus und des Zorns lenken, die mich sonst verbrannt htten.~
@1692 = ~Als Kommandeur war mein Platz in der Stadt, sie wollten wohl nicht alle fhigen Kmpfer abziehen.~
@1693 = ~Vielleicht wollte mich das Haus Despana auch nur in gut zu berwachender Nhe wissen.~
@1694 = ~Usstan tlun naut yibin!  I am not weak! I... I will manage.~
@1695 = ~Do not worry about me.~
@1696 = ~Hmph. Only a weakling would give in like that.~
@1697 = ~So? Is the sun too bright? Does the poor drow need to take a break in the shadow?~
@1698 = ~I... confess I would prefer a short rest outside the sun, indeed.~
@1699 = ~Your tone is nothing compared to the disdain our slaves face, blinded by the darkness in the Underdark.~
@1700 = ~(Zieht die Augenbrauen hoch) Das ist eine Frage, mit der Ihr unsere Freundschaft testen wollt, oder?~
@1701 = ~Sterben ist sinnlos. Es gibt keinen Grund freinander zu sterben, wenn man stark genug ist, den Gegner zu besiegen. Tten! Ich wrde fr Euch tten.~
@1702 = ~Ich denke, ich verstehe den Unterschied, ja. Habt Dank.~
@1703 = ~Das habt Ihr fr die Mutter Oberin ebenfalls getan.~
@1704 = ~Und was ist, wenn ich das nicht mchte?~
@1705 = ~Nein. Fr die Mutter Oberin musste ich tten. Fr Euch wrde ich tten. Es ist ein groer Unterschied.~
@1706 = ~Wenn Ihr das nicht mchtet? Ihr meint, wenn Ihr mich bittet, jemanden nicht zu tten, obgleich ich es fr das einzig richtige halte? Das ist eine sehr gute Frage.~
@1707 = ~Und eine schwer zu beantwortende. Denn wenn es mir sehr wichtig ist, diesen jemand zu tten, wre es nicht an Euch als Freund, es mir zuzugestehen?~
@1708 = ~(Solaufein fngt Eure Hand, bevor Ihr sein Haar berhren knnt.) Verzeiht... Ihr wolltet mich nicht schlagen, oder?~
@1709 = ~Wie bitte? Natrlich nicht! Ich wollte etwas aus Eurem Haar entfernen.~
@1710 = ~Vergesst es.~
@1711 = ~Ich bin ein erbrmlicher Freund fr einen Oberweltler. Verzeiht mir, <CHARNAME>.~
@1712 = ~Grmt Euch nicht. Ihr wurdet zu lange misshandelt, als dass Ihr die eingebten Verhaltensweisen innerhalb von ein paar Wochen ablegen knntet.~
@1713 = ~Ich htte es Euch auch einfach nur sagen knnen. Es ist an mir, mich zu entschuldigen.~
@1714 = ~Ihr mit Eurer anderen Kultur seid einfach anstrengend.~
@1715 = ~Nicht minder anstrengend ist es fr mich, mit Euren Gebruchen vertraut zu werden.~
@1716 = ~Das ist es, in der Tat. Ihr sprecht weise Worte, mein Freund.~ ~Das ist es, in der Tat. Ihr sprecht weise Worte, meine Freundin.~
@1717 = ~Dass Ihr Euch entschuldigt, verwirrt mich. (seufz) Ich habe noch viel zu lernen, wie es scheint.~
@1718 = ~Ich sehe, was Ihr aus meinem Haar entfernen wolltet. Habt Dank, ich werde es selbst tun.~
@1719 = ~<CHARNAME>, ich bin Jahrhunderte alt, und habe alles gesprt, was Schmerzen macht. Aber eines habe ich zuvor noch nie gesprt: Berhrungen, die keinen "Zweck" erfllen sollten. Die von Freundschaft und Vertrauen sprechen. Ihr knnt mir noch so viel beibringen, junger <PRO_RACE>.~
@1720 = ~Und um Eure Frage zu beantworten: Noch nie erfllte mich etwas mit mehr Freude als Eure Hand auf meinem Arm, mit der Ihr mir vergewissert, dass ich noch Euer Freund bin.~
@1721 = ~I will and would have, anyway. I will not gamble with the protection you are granting me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1722 = ~Ja, ich frage mich selbst, wie ich es bei den Elfen berstanden habe, ohne mit einem Messer im Rcken aufzuwachen. Sie scheinen ihrem magischen Knebel viel zuzutrauen. Oder Euch genug zu vertrauen.~
@1723 = ~Aber Ihr bezieht Euch darauf, dass ich nicht gegangen bin, als Ihr Eure Seele wiederhattet und Euer Feind besiegt war, nicht wahr? Nun, die schnelle Entwicklung der Dinge hat uns alle berrascht. Die Begierde, meine hellen Oberflchengeschwister nher kennen zu lernen, hat mich zu lange verweilen lassen, und nun sind wir hier.~
@1724 = ~Doch, ich werde Euch weiter untersttzen. Ihr seid mein Freund.~ ~Doch, ich werde Euch weiter untersttzen. Ihr seid meine Freundin.~
@1725 = ~(schnaubt) Auerdem sind die Zeiten der Bhaal-Unruhen denkbar ungnstig, um ein Umdenken meines Volkes herbeifhren zu wollen.~
@1726 = ~Doch, ich werde Euch weiter untersttzen. Die Zeiten der Bhaal-Unruhen sind denkbar ungnstig, um ein Umdenken meines Volkes herbeifhren zu wollen.~
@1727 = ~Fragt Ihr, weil ich nun mit Euch reise, anstatt meinen eigenen Plnen nach zu gehen?~
@1728 = ~Nun, die Zeiten der Bhaal-Unruhen sind denkbar ungnstig, um ein Umdenken meines Volkes herbeifhren zu wollen.~
@1729 = ~Es sind turbulente Zeiten. Solange die Bhaalkinder um den Thron ihres Vaters kmpfen, werden auch die Drow nicht zur Ruhe kommen. Wir sind alle gezwungen, die eine oder andere Seite zu whlen. Ich kann diese Zeit genauso gut in Eurer Begleitung verbringen.~
@1730 = ~Ich dachte lange Zeit, dass ich bereits in der Hlle wre, <CHARNAME>.~
@1731 = ~Dann kamt Ihr, zogt mich in die wahre Hlle... und lehrtet mich ausgerechnet hier, was Freundschaft ist.~
@1732 = ~Glaubt Ihr, es ging mir nur um das Aufsuchen der Oberwelt? Ihr kennt meinen glhendsten Wunsch, der mich angetrieben hat: Nach Gleichgesinnten zu suchen.~
@1733 = ~Wenn Ihr zufrieden seid, ist es gut.~
@1734 = ~Ja, aber die werdet Ihr hier auch nicht finden...~
@1735 = ~Knnt Ihr das hier denn?~
@1736 = ~Das ist wahr.~
@1737 = ~Von Eurer Hllenenklave aus sind wir schneller an weit entfernten Orten, als ich es mir je htte trumen lassen.~
@1738 = ~Das gefllt Euch?~
@1739 = ~Ich fhle mich dadurch fremdbestimmt, nicht bereichert.~
@1740 = ~Ich kann nur dorthin gehen, wohin ich gehen muss, nicht, wohin ich gehen mchte. Ich htte Euch gerne unter die Stadt Tiefwasser gefhrt, zu Eilistaees verborgenem Tempel.~
@1741 = ~Your powers give us far more possibilities to reach places, faster and wider spread than anything I would have imagined, even if it takes away the impressions only a far travel can give.~
@1742 = ~I need neither open sky nor the sun to know that I left the hell you call Underdark.~
@1743 = ~And I need neither rain-wet nor murky sleeping places to know that I enjoy the comfort your so-called hell enclave provides.~
@1744 = ~I thank you for considering it.~
@1745 = ~Yes, it does.~
@1746 = ~I understand this Sarevok is a former enemy of yours, and you just restored him to life... I myself benefitted from the same behaviour of yours: to spare your former enemies' life. Still, it takes me by surprise.~
@1747 = ~Considering you faught for your soul in hell itself only recently, I feel a little bit... deceived to see you hand parts of it over willingly.~
@1748 = ~That's how I am. If asked nicely, I do a lot for other people.~
@1749 = ~It was Imoen's choice, not mine.~
@1750 = ~The situation was completely different.~
@1751 = ~I don't really understand why I let this happen, either.~
@1752 = ~I had no choice!~
@1753 = ~I don't care how you feel about my decision, Solaufein.~
@1754 = ~That makes more sense than you are implying.~
@1755 = ~That may be.~
@1756 = ~I did criticise your action, but it is of no importance. This Sarevok is no match to you. He could turn into a nuisance, at most.~
@1757 = ~So, the times of Bhaal spawn fighting each other has begun.~
@1758 = ~So it seems.~
@1759 = ~Solaufein, not this question from you, too!~
@1760 = ~Hm, I fear you'll have to bear it if expecting your comrades to stay with you.~
@1761 = ~So, does the throne of your godly father interest you?~
@1762 = ~Absolutely. The power is in me, and I have a right to it.~
@1763 = ~I'm not sure... It's hard to imagine what it would mean.~
@1764 = ~That is no option. I so wished this wouldn't have anything to do with me!~
@1765 = ~Honestly, Solaufein, not you, too. I feel like I have to have this discussion with everyone at least once.~
@1766 = ~Well, you asked for my thoughts. And even if you'd write it onto a banner and carried it in front of you, I guess you'll be asked this question time and again.~
@1767 = ~Well, we will see how it turns out. I assume there will be quite a bit of work until then for you, though.~
@1768 = ~What is happening to us is mighty. Your godly powers, even the representatives of the gods are coming for you.~
@1769 = ~Bt it is this time - Faern is filled with bloodthirsty children of Bhaal. Everyone is experiencing mighty times. Even in the Underdark it will be the same.~
@1770 = ~But most people are just exposed to the threat and lose their lives. I prefer being with you on this side of things very much.~
@1771 = ~After what I see you doing here, creating this hell enclave, communicating with the gods, I am surprised you didn't wipe Ust Natha off it's hinges while passing through. You are very powerful, <CHARNAME>.~
@1772 = ~When you asked me to join your company, I was unsure you would be able to protect me against all odds at the surface. That doubt vanished soon as I saw how you cut your way through the drow posts to your way to the exit.~
@1773 = ~When I saw you fight your way through the drow posts, I also knew you didn't spare my life in Ust Natha because you wanted to avoid a fight with a potentially dangerous opponent. I was no match for you even then.~
@1774 = ~Now you are more powerful than anyone I have ever met... and I am old, <CHARNAME>.~
@1775 = ~Maybe, but with my increase in power, even stronger enemies seem to seek me out.~
@1776 = ~That means now you would not hesitate as long to join me, would we meet now?~
@1777 = ~Yes, and I am not finished yet. We need to get going.~
@1778 = ~Now I would hesitate even longer, <CHARNAME>, because I know that I cannot defeat you, would you decide to harm me.~
@1779 = ~I didn't think of that.~
@1780 = ~You know I won't ever do that. We are friends.~
@1781 = ~I would never do that. We are allies.~
@1782 = ~Wise thinking.~
@1783 = ~I won't recite the saying about moths and the light.~
@1784 = ~I don't know you wouldn't do that. But I trust in that you won't.~
@1785 = ~Isn't that what I said?~
@1786 = ~Then we should go.~
@1787 = ~You would, were you in my situation.~
@1788 = ~Not quite. You might not see a difference in our statements, but for me the concept of trust is new, and I feel its power even stronger.~
@1789 = ~This... town is different to what we encountered in Amn.~
@1790 = ~Overall, the behaviour of the common folk in this town reminds me of the one I was used to. It is different, of course. All those monks doing their suppressing as they see fit, you woudn't see those in a Drow city. Way too much autonomously lived out actions of power and suppression, no matron mother would tolerate that.~
@1791 = ~But the town folk is frightened, careful not to rise any suspicion. That is what I mean. This Balthazar knows how to terrorise a city, I have to grant him that. And he does it without leaving is monastery.~
@1792 = ~(snort!) That's the advantage of a Drow city. You don't have to go and search for a way to get to who is in charge of suppressing the inhabitants there.~
/* c#solau.d */
@1793 = ~Solaufein! This is how we meet again?~
@1794 = ~Yes. We have here the eggs of the Lady Adalon and will bring them to safety.~
@1795 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider.~
@1796 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider. I asked him to join me, and he will leave the Underdark on his own and wait for me at the surface, on the South-East of the elf camp.~
@1797 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider. I asked him to join me, and he will come to me before we leave the Underdark.~
@1798 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider. Alas, he didn't show me how long he would last fighting with two knives. I will not see him again.~
@1799 = ~Solaufein's Rescue~

/* c#solauB_ee.d */
@1800 = ~I can't believe I am travelling with someone like you, Dorn... Evil, brutal, merciless.~
@1801 = ~I could easily free you from this pain, drow.~
@1802 = ~There is a deeper layer in your words, and I do enjoy irony. But sadly, all your words are proving is what I said before.~
@1803 = ~Hexxat, when I heard the term 'creature of the night' the first time, my endless narcissism let me think it's meant for us drow.~
@1804 = ~*Let* me guess what is meant instead.~
@1805 = ~You have three guesses.~
@1806 = ~Dorn, when offering to spare me travelling with you, you didn't mean you would leave the group, did you?~
@1807 = ~No. You know what I was referring to.~
@1808 = ~I think I know, yes. Don't you think <CHARNAME> would have a say in this, too?~
@1809 = ~Afraid?~
@1810 = ~Of you? Dorn, you *know* where I come from, yes?~
@1811 = ~Hexxat, there is a certain... satisfaction to travelling with a creature suffering under the sun even more than oneself.~
@1812 = ~Really? I couldn't tell.~
@1813 = ~A jest! I am stunned.~
@1814 = ~Great, maybe it spares us your whining for a while.~
@1815 = ~That wasn't nice.~
@1816 = ~Did it hurt? Even though it came from a 'creature of the night', from the deeps of the darkness.~
@1817 = ~Oh, there are a lot of things capable to hurt, and more than just a sunburn.~
@1818 = ~Do you always strive to have the final say?~
@1819 = ~Only sometimes.~
@1820 = ~And, Hexxat? Do surfacers taste differently than drow?~
@1821 = ~It depends on where they were living. Everyone kind of develops an own flavor, you know...~
@1822 = ~I had the chance of tasting drow who never left the Underdark. They tasted... muffled, somehow moldered.~
@1823 = ~Is that so? This doesn't sound very flattering. I would have thought the magic would make them thrilling somehow.~
@1824 = ~*Thrilling* I would call the taste of a drow being at the surface for some time... Long enough to have lost the moldered taste, but not long enough to have lost all of his magic.~
@1825 = ~That sounds interesting, indeed. Let me know if you'll find one.~
@1826 = ~A-haha! Ha!~
@1827 = ~You will notice if that'd be the case.~
@1828 = ~You don't say!~
@1829 = ~Ouch! Wilson, no offence, but that was my foot.~
@1830 = ~I do not mind you to be so close to me, at least not until now. If you do continue to trample on my foot, I'll have to re-evaluate your threatening potential, though.~
@1831 = ~It's funny how you surface animals seem to be all soft and fluffy.~
@1832 = ~Compare this hairy beast with what is to be found in the Underdark. It's either scales or slime or carapace all over.~
@1833 = ~You-you are referring to Wilson, yes? Soft and fluffy? I mean, I-I see what you mean, but to call a wild bear soft and fluffy...~
@1834 = ~Oh, Wilson, if you look l-like that... Aren't you the *fluffiest* thing?...~
@1835 = ~Yes, fluffy. They were well sought after in the Underdark, because of their ability to keep warm: bear pelts.~
@1836 = ~AND of course they were a sign of great drow-heroism. But I have to admit it was because the drow had to be on the surface to get the pelt, not necessarily because a bear was seen to be a great threat... Sorry, my friend.~
@1837 = ~Only a creature of the Underdark could call one of the mightiest creatures of the forest soft and fluffy! Wait until the bear shows its teeth and claws!~
@1838 = ~These little pointy things?~
@1839 = ~Wilson, it is a sad truth that a bear's claws and teeth are no comparison to those of, say, a Cavvekan.~
@1840 = ~You mean any Cavvekan is far away, but you are nearby so I should watch my tongue? You do have a point there, Wilson.~
@1841 = ~Wilson, you are right. There is one thing where you keep up with any Cavvekan...~
@1842 = ~The stench.~
@1843 = ~But I do admit that you are a fine beast. And I definitely prefer having you on my side than having you against me.~
/* Sendai's Lair */
@1844 = ~Ah, the Underdark... yes, it feels familiar.~ [c#ablank]
@1845 = ~I do hope we will not stay long enough to give the recovery of my magical abilities a try, though. My feeling of attachment is far from strong enough for it!~

/* c#solauj */
@1846 = ~(scoffs) Sometimes? Life must have been kind to you if you still think it goes *sometimes* differently than imagined.~

/* c#solau */
@1847 = ~And you *are* drow? This is your true form? And yet...~

/* C#Solau_AR2100.baf */
@1848 = ~Drider Brood Chambers~

/* c#solau.D */
@1849 = ~And what about you, Veldrin... Did Phaere send you to another mission? It does not matter. I will come back to you, should there be the need for it!~
@1850 = ~And what about you, surfacer... whereever you came from. It does not matter. I will come back to you, should there still be the need for it!~

/* C#SOLAU_PID.D */
@1851 = ~Solaufein, come nearer, I need access to your inventory.~
@1852 = ~Solaufein, please warn me if your health gets too low in the next fight.~
@1853 = ~Solaufein, I want you to stop warning me about your health conditions in our fights.~ 
@1854 = ~With pleasure - if someone else moves away.~
@1855 = ~As you wish.~

/* C#solau.baf */
@1856 = ~I was nearly dead.~
@1857 = ~Now it is much better.~
@1858 = ~I need healing!~
@1859 = ~Ouch!~

/* c#solau.D */
@1860 = ~I just need you to make some room. Get in line behind the others.~


/* C#SOLAU_PID.D */
@1861 = ~Is this really a serious question? I do not detect any mockery in it. How different to how we drow treat our in the darkness blind slaves.~
@1862 = ~Is there something else you want to comment on life on the surface, Solaufein?~
@1863 = ~Is there anything else you have on your mind?~
@1864 = ~Yes, I am surprised that I survived the time in that Elven city without waking up with a knife in my back. They didn't seem to expect much evil from me - or they trusted you well enough.~

/* C#solau.baf */
@1865 = ~I am ready to answer more questions, if you like.~

/* C#SOLAU_PID.D */
@1866 = ~(in a melodramatic voice) Oh, Drizzt, can I have some of your hair, too?~
@1867 = ~I surely hope a scene like these Drizzt admirers will not happen again.~
@1868 = ~(snort!) And thinking I was afraight they would attack me... Let us move on, <CHARNAME>, or next thing happening will be I being arrested for impostering as Drizzt.~ 
@1869 = ~This Drizzt-hair fencing is hilarious. You could have made some easy gold with it!~
@1870 = ~Thank you for not trading with that smuggler. Even if it's only small sums, I do not appreciate people being conned.~
@1871 = ~I can't believe how far this went! And I didn't even *do* anything! But then... maybe that was the problem. (mutters to himself) Surfacers...~

/* c#solauB_ee.d */
@1872  = ~Neera, please keep your distance.~
@1873  = ~What? Me? Why me? You're afraid of *me*?~
@1874  = ~Not you, personally. Wild magic is a powerful thing. Powerful, and... unpredictable. I do not wish to be target to your wild surges.~
@1875  = ~Well, who does... But really? You complained about your loss of magic. And you'd not be grateful if I'd give you some of mine?~
@1876  = ~This remark doesn't make any sense and you know it.~
@1877  = ~Did you tell <CHARNAME> the same thing?~
@1878  = ~<CHARNAME> is our leader and freed me from the drider pits. I knew what I was getting into when joining <PRO_HIMHER>.~

@1879  = ~Solaufein, you want me to keep my magic to myself?~
@1880  = ~Yourself and our enemies, yes.~
@1881  = ~Unless a wild surge changes my fireball into something good?~
@1882  = ~Unless that, yes.~
@1883  = ~Well, what can I say. At least I still *have* my magic?~
@1884  = ~(scoff) Very true. And well spoken.~

@1885  = ~Neera, I shouldn't scold the unpredictability of your magic. With most of my magic lost, I can relate to one's magic being unreliable very much.~
@1886  = ~Was that an apology? I take it as an apology. The drow said 'I'm sorry' to me!~
@1887  = ~If you want to see it that way. It was a true statement, at least. Although I guess having powerful magic that is unpredictable is even worse than my condition. This is an interesting thought I have to ponder on.~
@1888 = ~Ohh, and that sounded very much like thanking me for a very insightful thought. I am thrilled! The drow said 'sorry' and 'thank you' in the same conversation!~

@1889 = ~Neera, how do *you* deal with the frustration the unpredictability of your magic holds?~
@1890 = ~Well, there was a time were I was searching for an answer to make it more predictable. But life is tough and unfair, because there is none, really. So I braced myself and keep on telling me that *every* spell tends to wear off after some time. And also, I always have some nuts and bisquits in my backpack, just in case...~
@1891 = ~And, what can I say - at least I still *have* my magic?~
@1892 = ~(snort!) I remember that one. I see that your problems are different than mine, or at least does your strategy, if I call it that, not help me in my condition. I thank you for your answer, nontheless.~

@1893  = ~Wilson, as much as I am surprised to find myself conversing with a bear, I have to put something straight. I might have been ready to complain about your stench, my good beast. Until I noticed that - given several days in a row on sunny, dusty roads following night camps in the wilderness... none of us has a right to complain to you any more.~
@1894  = ~Exactly.~

@1895  = ~It is surprising to think of *how* convincing the Silver Lady's illusion was.~ 
@1896  = ~I saw you fight in the Underdark, Rasaad, but it never occurred to me that it is monk's movements I am looking at.~
@1897  = ~I saw you and <CHARNAME> fight in the Underdark, Rasaad, but it never occurred to me that it is monk's movements I am looking at.~
@1898  = ~We were lucky then... This way of fighting never struck you as odd?~
@1899  = ~It did feel odd to me, but I thought you'd be a specially trained male some paranoid - or wise, depending on perspective - matron mother raised to have protection in a 'no weapon' zone, or that you yourself were aiming at a matron to impress her with your weaponless fight. I also noticed very quickly that you are good at what you are doing, so I didn't see a reason to talk about it.~
@1900  = ~Never it occurred to me that I might be looking at a deception.~
@1901  = ~Perhaps this was one of the reasons the illusion was so powerful - because it presented us in a way noone even considered a deception.~
@1902  = ~You mean if it looks like a drow and talks like a drow just right enough, even our people's very own suspiciousness doesn't suffice to make us questioning whether it actually would *be* a drow? Well, that would fit nicely to my opinion that my race is blinded by its own arrogance.~

@1903  = ~Dorn, I am even more surprised finding myself travelling with you *still*.~
@1904  = ~You thought <CHARNAME> would chose between us?~
@1905  = ~Actually, I was more expecting that I would have to kill you at some point.~
@1906  = ~Pfeh. We could still see how that would turn out, drow.~
@1907  = ~I'm not so sure any more that it will come to this, to be honest, if it hasn't yet. And - we do have other problems, currently. But yes, I would be ready.~
@1908  = ~As am I.~
@1909  = ~I know.~

@1910  = ~Rasaad, I do say it still puzzles me how a man can fight with nothing but his fists.~
@1911  = ~It's power granted by the gods. In return, a monk hands himself to his god completely - including the vow to never wield a weapon other than his god's power.~
@1912  = ~I do understand that it is comparable with the magic a priest has at his disposal, but still - the combination of magic with your own body force still strikes me as unordinary. I liked being able to wield magic, but nothing compares to a good weapon in my hand. Without it, I would feel naked.~

@1913  = ~Solaufein, you think me a smaller threat because I use no weapons?~
@1914  = ~On the contrary. I understand very well that you *are* your weapon. Thinking about it even makes me a bit uneasy - an armed man can be *unarmed*, at least. A mage can be stopped by a no magic zone. But you? You are unstoppable.~
@1915  = ~Unless I lose my god's blessing...~
@1916  = ~Unless this, but that, my friend, is a different thing altogether, I would assume.~

@1917  = ~Rasaad, would it be appropriate to ask you to show me some of your fighting moves?~
@1918  = ~Well, I can show you some if you want, but I doubt you will be able to perform them with the strength necessary - the strength a monk was granted by his god.~
@1919  = ~I agree, but nevertheless, a physically strong person should be able to use them beneficially if fighting unarmed.~
@1920  = ~Very well. Put your feet like this...~
@1921  = ~You do have a lot of strength and do not hesitate to use it, but you are missing some of the acrobatics needed, especially for the kicks.~
@1922  = ~Indeed, I do... How do you prevent the edge of the hand to burn after hitting with it repeatedly?~
@1923  = ~I don't, because mine doesn't burn any more - but before, I trained until it stopped.~
@1924  = ~I see. I always thought my body is used to being maltreated in any way possible, but I see now that there are still ways to go, if I want to become as hardened as you.~
@1925  = ~Only in this regard. Let me swing a sword and hold a shield for some hours, and I am very sure my muscles would ache and shake all over.~
@1926  = ~You mean it is always what we are used to that determines what we are capable of? This sounds like a very wise statement - and still leaves room for hope that we are capable of shaping our own lifes if we invest enough dedication. I thank you for all three you did for me today, Rasaad: sharing your time, passing on some of your knowledge, and giving me something to ponder on.~

/* c#solau_pid.d */
@1927  = ~I don't have a problem with you showing your origin while we are in the cities. The more people will see you the sooner they will get used to a drow at my side.~ 
@1928 = ~Well... I will try to cover myself a little, nontheless, hoping to prevent provoking people into driving me out of your group before they can get used to my presence... I will not gamble with the protection you are granting me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1929 = ~(snort!) Don't you think this joke is getting old?~
@1930 = ~Solaufein, please talk to other group members as seldom as possible.~
@1931 = ~Solaufein, please talk to other group members as often as possible.~
@1932 = ~Solaufein, please switch back to talking more often to other group members.~
@1933 = ~Solaufein, please switch back to talking less often to other group members.~

/* C#solau.baf */
@1934 = ~Cursed sun!~
@1935 = ~Ah, that is much better.~
