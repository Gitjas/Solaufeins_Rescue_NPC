@7    = ~(growls) Finally! I started doubting you would be true to your word and actually come for me, after that excessive talk you had with those surface elves.~ [UDSOLA07]
@8    = ~You recognize me?~
@9    = ~Good to see you again!~
@10   = ~The elves were suspicious against us, too, Solaufein.~
@11   = ~Watch your tone, will you?~
@12   = ~I waited alone at this place long enough for sure.~
@13   = ~And the cursed sun is up, too!~
@14   = ~Yes, they are very mistrustful. Quite comprehensible from their point of view, I can't hold it against them.~
@15   = ~I phrased my discomfort, nothing more.~
@16   = ~Already I regret the descision to wait here for you. After the distraction you caused, sneaking by the elves was easy enough, though.~
@17   = ~I already told you I did not succeed in getting the surface armor I was mentioning before. And my drow equipment turned to dust... as expected.~
@18   = ~That's no problem. I will equip you accordingly.~
@19   = ~Calm down. You are unsettled, I understand.~
@20   = ~Do you want to come along or do you prefer having a conversation?~
@21   = ~Two lousy knives is all you got? You've got to be kidding.~
@22   = ~Hmph. We'll see how appropriate the armory of the surface will be. I am still waiting to see one that can compete to the ones I am used to.~
@23   = ~Come on, let's go.~
@24   = ~Proud words!~
@25   = ~Feel free to spread that dust you've got there over your torso, if you prefer.~
@26   = ~I have no use for you now, you'll have to wait a bit longer.~
@27   = ~You are right. I apologize for my arrogance. Here even the lousiest leather armor is better than any plate mail of adamantite. And I can call myself lucky if you'll provide me with one.~
@28   = ~With pleasure.~
@29   = ~You should not let me wait too long here in the sun. Unless you prefer me well done!~
@30   = ~Can I join you now?~
@31   = ~No.~
@32   = ~Hm, truth be told, this opportunity is far too tempting. Let's see how long you can withstand with only two silly knifes!~
@33   = ~Hmph.~
@34   = ~(snort!) Sure, I really enjoy kidding if it puts my life into danger.~
@35   = ~There you are again!~
@36   = ~You are attacking me? I can't believe my own naivite. No, I do not have to fight all battles. Especially one that puts the odds against me!~

@38   = ~Yes, 'Veldrin'. I already took a good look at you, when the silver dragon took you to the exit.~
@39   = ~Can I join you again?~
@40   = ~Hmph. I'll let you know when I'm well done roasting.~
@41   = ~Hmph. If you say so.~
@42   = ~You want us to go separate ways?~
@43   = ~Wait for me here.~
@44   = ~No, stay with the group, Solaufein.~
@45   = ~Veldrin! For whatever reason you are attacking me, so be it!~
@46   = ~Veldrin! ...Or whatever your name would be. You made it out of the temple and the city alive! You are indeed impressive.~
@47   = ~You are on your way to the silver dragon now, are you not?~

@49   = ~Why do you want to know? Your question arouses suspicion!~
@50   = ~I felt the shock going through the city. The house Despana fell, even though not everyone might have noticed yet.~
@51   = ~I could not remain in the shadows. The more I see from you, the more amazing you are.~
@52   = ~That is what I suspected.~
@53   = ~You fooled the whole city... And again a megalomaniac Matron Mother fell by her own arrogance and pride, and the drow were put in their place.~
@54   = ~You know, we are preparing for war... For war against the surfacers. Ha! I needed to make sure it was indeed the silver dragon you are working for. It is her last definite move to show my fatuous people their limits.~
@55   = ~May your escape from the Underdark be a successful one... or wherever you wished to go from here. Curiousity fills me to see your true form, but I should not linger, least in the open. So, I will go back to...~
@56   = ~Wait, who is approaching? Cursed it be, I was too careless! Veldrin, quick, draw your weapons, it's the...~
@57   = ~Solaufein! Treacherous spy! So I did notice correctly that you maggot sneaked around in the dark corners of the city's streets!~
@58   = ~*Me* you were following? ...You are not aware of what happened in the city since you left in my pursuit, are you?~
@59   = ~I know the Matron Mother executes a dangerous ritual for which the doors were sealed. But I also know that the protection of your house lapsed!~
@60   = ~...Indeed. Veldrin, stay out of this. She was so determined to catch me, the renegate, that she seems oblivious to anything else.~
@61   = ~Well then, Imrae. You found me. I laugh into your face, because you are as badly off as me - only you are still ignorant of it!~
@62   = ~Be quiet, little maggot! How do you dare speak to me? But it is unimportant. You will come with me. Your fate is sealed! You will give a fine drider, indeed!~
@63   = ~...Drider? No! No!... Kill! You are supposed to kill me! Feed me to the spiders!...~
@64   = ~Now you squirm properly, male!~
@65   = ~Veldrin, do not let this happen. Follow us! Look into the crevice beside the bridge, you will find a...~
@66   = ~Silence, maggot! I heard your voice long enough!~
@67   = ~Solaufein's Rescue

Solaufein, the male fighter captain whos life I spared, waited for me outside the drow city. There he was discovered and arrested by a Handmaiden of Lolth, unfortunately. She seemed not to be aware of the recent ongoings inside the city, much to my advantage. Solaufein she took with her however to the drider chambers somewhere down here. 
If I want to spare Solaufein the fate of being turned into a drider, I should follow them and free him! He tried to tell me something about a hidden crevice beside the bridge near Adalon's lair. I should look inside to see what is in there.
And I should decide whether I want to bring the Silver Lady her eggs as soon as possible. How long does such a transformation to a drider take?...~
@68   = ~Vel'uss zhah doerin? *Kivvin*! Elgg mina!~
@69   = ~Who is this? What are you doing here? You are not supposed to be here!~
@70   = ~Veldrin!~
@71   = ~I... I thank you. You freed me from the drider cocoon! You found the rune stone, as I hoped.~
@72   = ~How are you?~
@73   = ~Indeed. I hope I get a reward for this!~
@74   = ~I just happen to come by.~
@75   = ~Ol zhah dos?... It is you, is it not? Surfacer... Now I see your true look.~
@76   = ~(snort!) If a pair of rosty knives and a rather old surface armor is to your liking - because that would be all I could offer you from here.~
@77   = ~What a friendly question... after you had to rescue me from my own stupidity. To answer it: I am well, considering the circumstances, Veldrin.~
@78   = ~You just came by? So, you found the rune stone giving you pass to the drider chambers, killed the present drow, and opened my cocoon, all by accident? What lucky accident for me, indeed, Veldrin.~
@79   = ~(snort!) This name is not appropriate any more. I should not use it. Forgive me.~
@80   = ~Dear Imrae was so decided to bring me in she indeed missed the recent happenings inside the city. As soon as we arrived here she was ordered back to her house. I assume we won't see here too soon again, if ever. Everyone belonging to the former house Despana is occupied with other problems now!~
@81   = ~You freed me just in time. The transformation did not start yet, as they did not put me into a cocoon right away, but... Never mind. It is over. You saved me from becoming an abomination, and I have nothing but my thanks in return. (snort!) Thankfulness of a drow, what a great reward.~
@82   = ~We already agreed on meeting at the surface. I will go there now, if you still want me to join you.~
@83   = ~Yes, Solaufein. I will expect you there, just as we agreed in front of the Ust Natha's city gates!~
@84   = ~No, this experience changed you. I prefer you as you are now.~
@85   = ~I will await you there. Be assured, you will not hear from what happened here ever again.~
@86   = ~Is that so?~
@87   = ~I would like to give you are reward, but I have nothing of value... I will go back hiding into the shadows. My hopes are high that the fall of house Despana stirred so much tension my existence will no longer be of interest.~
@88   = ~On second thought, I would prefer you how you were before, when we agreed to meet at the surface.~
@89   = ~I would like you to join me, Solaufein, but with the experiences you made here in the drider chambers.~
@90   = ~I would like you to join me, Solaufein. Come with me!~
@91   = ~I wish you luck, Solaufein. Fare well!~
@92   = ~Well, then be off!~
@93   = ~I would come with you?~
@94   = ~You... you are not serious, <CHARNAME>?~
@95   = ~Think careful about taking a drow into the group, <CHARNAME>.~
@96   = ~Hmm, darf elf has dark skin of evil drow, but Minsc is not sure if this one needs butt kicking. What do you think, Boo?~
@97   = ~Hmm, darf elf has dark skin of evil drow, but Minsc is not sure if this one needs butt kicking.~
@98   = ~Oh yes, wonderful idea. We 'enforce' this group by taking on a weakened, unarmed renegade.~
@99   = ~Well, his character seems to be different to most drow, indeed. But we shouldn't take the "helping others" too far, you know...~
@100  = ~Bah! Don't fool yourself by planning on taking a drow on his first trip into the surface sunlight! This male won't be anything more than a nuisance, and slow us down remarkably.~
@101  = ~I am undecided in this matter.~
@102  = ~Are you sure, <CHARNAME>? I know he was helpful and all, but still...~
@103  = ~Do you seriously consider taking this drow on?! Keep in mind that his presence will make us a target to all kinds of hostilities - being hunted by his own kind included!~
@104  = ~Ha! You are truly the savior of all fallen and renegates. I won't be part of the complications his presence will undoubtedly resolve in!~
@105  = ~Deliberate about this decision well, <CHARNAME>. His presence will raise tensions - and with that I am not only referring to the ones we will encounter from others.~
@106  = ~No, <PRO_RACE>. Your true nature is no secret. Even with your help until now you represent what I am trying to leave behind me.~
@107  = ~Why would you want me to join you? Because I proved to be such a good and vigilant warrior? (snort!)~
@108  = ~How did you imagine this to happen? Do you expect me to leave my realm because I am being hunted - and go to the surface, unprotected, unable to blend in, to be hunted there?~
@109  = ~And yet, your offer is intriguing. I have no doubt my chance of finding like-minded drow in Ust Natha is currently very little, with all of us goaded and full of blood thirst... And travel to other drow cities is long, with no prove I will be more sufficient in hiding there, if I failed so miserable here.~
@110  = ~I... am inclined on taking on your offer. Much I heard about your world, yet never I was there. Not like this, accompanying a surfacer. Leaving the Underdark offers so many possibilities...~
@111  = ~I could meet with the few drow who turned their back on our evil siblings. I... I could meet true followers of Eilistraee. Yes. This is what I want.~
@112  = ~This would be my only condition for you, surfacer. That you grant me this.~
@113  = ~Come again? Do you think *I* could organize a meeting with Drizzt Do'Urden? How about a reality check?!~
@114  = ~Finding true followers of Eilistraee? Hm, I would have to inquire first, but that should be possible.~
@115  = ~It's not up to you to make demands, drow. Join me or leave it.~
@116  = ~Of course not. I spoke of followers of Eilistraee as they exist on the surface. Starting from there I will find what I seek.~
@117  = ~I thank you!~
@118  = ~Before you join up I should tell you that I am chasing a mighty enemy. Maybe you saw him. He was an ally of house Despana for your war against the surface elves.~
@119  = ~I am chasing a mighty mage who took my soul.~
@120  = ~Well then!~
@121  = ~Very good. This will suffice.~
@122  = ~Your soul? I surely heard about much less relevent reasons for a chase!~
@123  = ~I will regain my strength and be of use to you. But I have no illusions: Travelling with you on the surface, I will be in need of you giving me shelter. Are you willing to grant it to me?~
@124  = ~Yes, Solaufein.~
@125  = ~Do you need my protection? You can leave and go elsewhere any time, you know.~
@126  = ~I am not doing this out of charity, Solaufein. I expect you to fight for my goals, while you are travelling under my protection.~
@127  = ~No, I don't need anyone burdening me. Better we go separate ways!~
@128  = ~You showed here as well as in Ust Natha readiness to support me even if it would be a risk to you - although why is still a mystery to me.~
@129  = ~Hmph. I will be very vulnerable where you are going to. Never would I risk such a thing without your company! But you are right, I wouldn't need your protection to survive, not here, not at the surface, either.~
@130  = ~So I will join forces with a surfacer, then.~
@131  = ~But you are under the spell of the Silver Lady, still. She won't want to see me...~
@132  = ~When do you want me to meet up with you?~
@133  = ~I want you to come with me right away.~
@134  = ~Could you follow us unobtrusively until we are at the surface?~
@135  = ~Are you asking because I hid so efficiently only recently, yes? (snort!) But yes, I should be able to do that.~
@136  = ~I wish the same to you, surfacer.~
@137  = ~I will not go with you. As fascinating as the idea sounds, it does not withstand reality.~
@138  = ~I will.~
@139  = ~I thank you. Shall you get into trouble in the Underdark and I would be nearby, I will not forget your mercy!~
@140  = ~And if the silver dragon turns you back to your original form, are you ready to explain my presence to her? I have no intention of facing this mighty creature. None of my seemingly good deeds of the last days can ever undo the cruelty we brought upon her.~
@141  = ~I do not wish to accompany you right away, <CHARNAME>. Do not worry. I have learnt my lesson. No Handmaiden of Lolth will catch me again.~
@142  = ~I will go on a quick stroll and collect the things I hid in the caves. It is not my intention to join you without any equipment!~
@143  = ~You go ahead. I will meet with you then.~
@144  = ~Keep them distracted with your noisy surfacer trampling. This will give me enough opportunity to follow you unnoticed. We will meet again at the surface. I will wait for you there!~
@145  = ~<CHARNAME>! Wait. I know we agreed upon meeting at the surface, but I thought about it and changed my mind. I want to join you now.~
@146  = ~Here I am, <CHARNAME>. Your way through the drow posts was impressing. I would have met up with you sooner, but you were surprisingly fast - or I was too slow. You did not need my help, so much is clear.~
@147  = ~Going past the elf posts unnoticed wouldn't be a problem, not for me as one single drow, used to hide in the shadows. But I want to enter the surface honestly and openly - do you see? I am sick of hiding. If the elves won't have me, at least the pathetic play would come to a quick ending.~
@148  = ~But I did not succeed in getting the surface armor I was mentioning before. I should have refrained my pride in this regard, I am standing in front of you as defenseless as I was after climbing out of that drider cocoon.~
@149  = ~Of course, you are welcome to join.~
@150  = ~I like this. Join in then.~
@151  = ~A quick ending? It would give *me* the troubles if the elves would grow suspicious or hostile on your behalf!~
@152  = ~I am sorry, but I can't take you with me now.~
@153  = ~Which is the reason why I would like to go in your company - because I am intelligent enough to know that I wouldn't last a minute if stepping into the open on my own.~
@154  = ~No thanks, I fought enough battles already. I have no interest in risking another due to a misunderstanding. You'll need to find your own way to the surface.~
@155  = ~This is a step you'll need to take on your own, Solaufein.~
@156  = ~(snort!) So much for my nobel approach. But I have understanding for your answer - I would have done the same, on your account. I will follow you quietly then. Search me outside of the elven camp.~

//c#solauJ.d
@157  = ~So I did emerge to the surface with you. I left a society where I could be commanded to and fro, humiliated without reason, and punished for a naught. This I left behind, or so I am hoping. Tell me, what are your plans for us from here?~ [c#ablank]
@158  = ~I am chasing a powerful mage who stole my soul.~
@159  = ~I'm in search of the man who helped inciting the drow for war against the surface elves. He did terrible things to me.~
@160  = ~Pfeh. I point, you fight. You don't need to know anything more.~
@161  = ~You think so?~
@162  = ~Well, I will follow you then, <CHARNAME> from the surface.~
@163  = ~Yes, so you told me before.~
@164  = ~Your soul?!~
@165  = ~Hm, and in these circumstances you want to burden your company with a drow?~
@166  = ~And more than one.~
@167  = ~You seem to be certain to be able to handle the problems araising from travelling with drow.~
@168  = ~Terrible things?~
@169  = ~Yes, he stole my soul!~
@170  = ~Torture, to be precise.~
@171  = ~You don't need to know any details.~
@172  = ~I need your protection, and I will show my appreciation for the help you grant me, and fight for your cause.~
@173  = ~But let me phrase it plainly: I expect from my time here with you, that I will become familiar with life on the surface. I want to find supporters for my personal endeavor: to lead the drow back on the right path. I was weakened and I fled. But I will regain my strength, and I will return.~
@174  = ~That is a noble goal, Solaufein. I feel honored by your presence, and I hope that you will achieve what you aim for.~
@175  = ~That is alright - I do something for you, you'll do something for me.~
@176  = ~Be warned, drow. Don't you think you could abandon me somewhere you think it fit. Remember, I am watching you.~
@177  = ~These are very friendly words... I lack experience to know whether they are truly meant.~
@178  = ~Then we are of one mind.~
@179  = ~That is wise of you, I won't blame you. It is a high risk you are takig, traveling with a drow.~
@180  = ~I thank you for the protection you are providing me with. I'm not planning on imposing on your kindness.~
@181  = ~My magic decreased significantly since I left the Underdark, <CHARNAME>. It is... unsettling, if not frightening.~ [c#ablank]
@182  = ~Which abilities did you lose?~
@183  = ~Your honesty surprises me. Doesn't this contradict the drowish way of never to show a weakness?~
@184  = ~I think you are still very strong, Solaufein.~
@185  = ~You'll have to get used to it.~
@186  = ~You call it frightening?~
@187  = ~To list them all is pointless, but what I did lose are abilities I took for granted.~
@188  = ~No, it doesn't, because you are my leader and you will notice my weakness in the next fight, <CHARNAME>, and so it is the wiser choice to tell you about it now.~
@189  = ~In addition to my lost magic there is my blindness in this bright sunlight. I... did not exaggerate when I asked for your protection, <CHARNAME>.~
@190  = ~You still have it, I assure you.~
@191  = ~This honesty is one of the things I like on you, Solaufein.~
@192  = ~Get a grip on yourself, will you?~
@193  = ~I do not plan on remaining this weak! The followers of Eilistraee living at the surface, are they weak and blind? I will overcome these impairments, too... Eventually.~
@194  = ~But it is fitting, you know. The moment I am able to actually *see* our enemies, they are so up close that fighting them with magic would be of no advantage anyway!...~
@195  = ~It is good I know that you are a capable fighter, or else I would be worried concerning our fighting prowess.~
@196  = ~It's not like I could hide it. And I do not think it wise to pretend it would leave me unmoved. I am an experienced fighter and used to deprivations of multiple sorts. I can handle the restrictions the sun puts on me, but losing my magic is something else completely.~
@197  = ~Even a drow knows when pretending would turn into a bad idea!~
@198  = ~So, you are a child of Bhaal? I know Alaundo's Prophecies. The ones saying that the Bhaal spawn will turn the Sword Coast into chaos...~ [c#ablank]
@199  = ~Yes, I am.~
@200  = ~Sounds familiar, yes...~
@201  = ~Seems like everyone gets to know this sooner or later.~
@202  = ~Why would it be of importance?~
@203  = ~It is no wonder these prophecies found their way into the Underdark. Firstly, there are Bhaal spawn among the drow, too... and secondly, we drow wouldn't be who we are if we wouldn't try to use such a time to our own advantage.~
@204  = ~But I was asking about you I know the one we are pursuing stole you soul. A Bhaal spawn without <PRO_HISHER> soul...~
@205  = ~Did he do it to weaken you, or to gain strength for himself?~
@206  = ~He wanted to strengthen himself.~
@207  = ~He wanted to weaken me, surely.~
@208  = ~Both, I guess. He seems to like experimenting. It's well possible he watches me in my struggle, enjoying the sight.~
@209  = ~Whatever, Solaufein. What is your point?~
@210  = ~Although I never would have imagined to live these times like I do now. No longer in the Underdark, but at the side of a Bhaal spawn the solar calls the chosen one...~
@211  = ~I know it was the search for a mighty foe that lead you to the Underdark, in search for your soul. A Bhaal spawn without a soul is a thought I'd imagined to be rather unettling. Instead, it was you who came.~
@212  = ~I won't give in to the heritage's evil influences, Solaufein.~
@213  = ~Oh, there have been... incidents rather unconvenient for bystanders, you know.~
@214  = ~What is your point?~
@215  = ~Since I will be affected by it, this information holds some value to me, you know!~
@216  = ~I have to admit I am confused. I would have wished for a less... notable companion for my escape to the surface.~
@217  = ~But I don't mean to sound ungrateful. If you wouldn't have been who you are, you wouldn't have come to Ust Natha. I wouldn't be here but still down there, trying to decide whether living is worth the pain.~
@218  = ~Let's go and regain your soul, then.~
@219  = ~Let's go and continue shaping your destiny, then.~
@220  = ~I am sure he achieved his goal - if he can handle the soul, that is.~
@221  = ~If he managed to do that I am impressed just how strong you have to be with your soul!~
@222  = ~Even better if he watches. Because then he would be closer by and easier for us to find!~
@223  = ~So, I am travelling under the command of a surfacer named <CHARNAME> now.~ [c#ablank]
@224  = ~Not long ago, my only reaction would have been unbelieving laughter if commanded to do so. Although we might cooperate with surfacers, we drow believe to be the only superior race. Having to obey the commands of a surfacer would have been an unspeakable degradation.~
@225  = ~To be commanded by a <PRO_RACE>... Never I would have imagined such. I still need to adjust to the thought.~
@226  = ~Is it that bad?~
@227  = ~Still, you yearned for being at the surface, didn't you?~
@228  = ~The difference is whether being ordered to do so, or having the free choice.~
@229  = ~Yes, sometimes life goes differently than imagined.~
@230  = ~You really should rid yourself from your drow attitude, Solaufein.~
@231  = ~Great we talked about it. Let's move on.~
@232  = ~Bad? No. But very different.~
@233  = ~Different to what you imagined, or differnt to what your life was before?~
@234  = ~I didn't imagine being here. Not as a real option. I didn't dare to.~
@235  = ~Yes, I did. But yearning is a mere feeling, with no specifics.~
@236  = ~Depending on situation and opportunities. I know, <CHARNAME>.~
@237  = ~It is different to everything I experienced before, <CHARNAME>. But... not necessarily to the worse. And it wasn't my intention to imply this, either.~
@238  = ~Don't forget that the superiority of the drow was taught to me for centuries. This is the measure I weighted my world against until not too long ago...~
@239  = ~This of course is past, of which I want to part fully. I only mentioned it because I can't stop pondering about my current situation, <CHARNAME>. Considering how impressive everything turns out to be, it is no wonder I can't stop my thoughts from racing!~
@240  = ~As you wish!~
@241  = ~That's a nice name for centuries of indoctrination, but yes, I am working on it.~
@242  = ~I still recall the drow you were in Ust Natha. Some part of you was preserved by the spell of the Silver Lady. But being a <PRO_RACE> lets you seem much more authentic, much more convincing.~ [c#ablank]
@243  = ~Weren't I tricked by your appearance, I would have noticed in Ust Natha the impossibility of you being an Underdark drow.~ [c#ablank]
@244  = ~You did very well, and yet your... being different was palpable.~
@245  = ~'Being different'?~
@246  = ~I take this as a compliment, Solaufein!~
@247  = ~I beg your pardon?~
@248  = ~(snort!) If you say so.~
@249  = ~What I meant was your surfacer way of behaving. You might act all tough and fierce, but compared to a drow you are quite... soft.~
@250  = ~Soft?~
@251  = ~Maybe I am.~
@252  = ~So, where's the problem?~
@253  = ~That sounded like an insult. This conversation ends here.~
@254  = ~Kind.~
@255  = ~Kind equals soft?~
@256  = ~Well, it's the surface now. Politeness is the key for social interactions, Solaufein.~
@257  = ~It was only a remark. I am not implying your fighting skills are low or that you wouldn't be able to lead. It's only that... I need to get used to the fact that here, this is the normal way of interaction.~
@258  = ~It is difficult for me to embrace your friendly manners. Sometimes I am overcome by the suspicion that you are only playing me... that you might let me fall and leave me to the mob, or maybe just dispose of me yourself.~
@259  = ~I wouldn't do that.~
@260  = ~Same here, I keep thinking whether you might drop your friendly facade and turn against me at some point, Solaufein.~
@261  = ~I would call that a healthy mistrust.~
@262  = ~Yes, it would be possible something like that happens. You are drow, after all.~
@263  = ~Where I come frome, politeness is a sign of missing assertiveness. For drow, kindness equals weakness, and weakness means death. It... is hard for me to detach from the feeling this is how it would be, even though my sense tells me otherwise.~
@264  = ~(snort!) You are far easier to irritate than I thought if you feel offense in such a remark!~
@265  = ~Healthy mistrust, indeed.~
@266  = ~That's what most would say, <CHARNAME>.~
@267  = ~Despite my inquietude I am deeply impressed by your friendly interactions, <CHARNAME>. It is so... much less strenuous not having to expect a knife in the back at every moment.~
@268  = ~The most I am impressed by the laughter of your surfacers. The joyous, lighthearted, with a playful sparkle in the eyes... All I knew was the taunting, the triumphant, the humiliating laugh.~
@269  = ~But no wonder the drow never learnt to laugh the way you surfacers do. There is no light down there that could shine into the eyes and reveal that friendly shine which makes all hearts leap up of all creatures able to feel even a little empathy.~
@270  = ~I can only shake my head at the thought of you bringing the downfall of a whole city, disguised as a drow. Another proof of the blindness of my race, being deceived so easily.~ [c#ablank]
@271  = ~What do you mean 'easily'? The magic of a Silver Dragon was behind this!~
@272  = ~It was chaotic times. I think some saw what they wanted to see.~
@273  = ~The way you say it it sounds deprecative.~
@274  = ~Let's end the conversation here.~
@275  = ~This is true. This power is unmatched. Adalon has guarded the exit to the surface for immemorial time, without us being able to defeat her.~
@276  = ~(sigh) But now she's dead. You've done what the drows didn't achieve in centuries... I will not ponder for the reasons you did it. But we, too, were about to force the guardian of the exit to give up.~
@277  = ~I remember too well the recent events that led to the fall of an important House in Ust Natha... (One side of his mouth twitches grimly.)~
@278  = ~Even without my false dragon eggs you have found a way to cheat Phaere and Matron Mother Ardulace. Maybe your hiding game was already detected, I do not know. The important thing is that House Despana has fallen!~
@279  = ~Thanks to you. How much I would have liked to see Phaere's face!~
@280  = ~Why? Just because I said 'easily'?~
@281  = ~Yes, because of that. You used this word to make clear it wasn't my doing but only due to the 'blindness of your race'~
@282  = ~Hmph. Maybe I exaggerated a bit, but you have to see that the behavior of you surfacers is very different to the drows'. Looking back I am surprised we didn't see through your disguise sooner.~
@283  = ~<CHARNAME>, when you were turned into drow by Adalon's spell, did you talk the drow language like you do now your native tongue?~ [c#ablank]
@284  = ~Why are you asking?~
@285  = ~Yes, I did.~
@286  = ~The illusion went through and through. Even our own minds were fooled.~
@287  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Solaufein.~
@288  = ~Because I reminded myself that you were the drow being kind to me in the Underdark. I do recognize you, but you are a <PRO_RACE> now, and I am talking in your native tongue. In Ust Natha it was you speaking accent free drow language.~
@289  = ~For me, nothing changed about our conversations. I spoke drow without noticing.~
@290  = ~Is it usual for you to speak our tongue, as a drow?~
@291  = ~I do speak drow anyway, at least well enough.~
@292  = ~Solaufein, please spare me your *accent free* attention!~
@293  = ~Indeed? I am surprised to hear this. I guess I should ask you how it came to this and what your motivation was to learn it.~
@294  = ~But I feel like Drizzt, <CHARNAME>. Do not resent my notion, but I do not wish to hear this language any time soon.~
@295  = ~A pity. I would have liked practicing with you.~
@296  = ~I don't wish to talk about it, Solaufein.~
@297  = ~Maybe later, <CHARNAME>, when I'll be more accustomed to your way of living.~
@298  = ~Why don't you ask the priestess?~
@299  = ~Now we are talking yours, and I am glad to have learnt it so well.~
@300  = ~Yes. All drow are teached to speak it. And yet, my former matron would be surprised if hearing me talk like I do now. I am much more articualte and can express myself far more eloquently than my tuition would allow.~
@301  = ~Now I am curious. How did you learn to speak our language so well?~
@302  = ~Well... I used additional practice were I could get it, mostly with some of the slaves.~
@303  = ~I wanted to be able to speak your language perfectly. I told myself I would do it because of the advantages it would give me if confronted with surfacers...~
@304  = ~I think I never admitted it to myself and probably never would have, but the real reason was a yearning, a wanting... for your world.~
@305  = ~And now I am here, pronouncing words in this language I could only practice in secret for so long, and I feel... joy!~
@306  = ~I don't know what is the matter with me, I barely recognize myself. I am saying things to you I never would have in my own tonue. Things that are on my mind...~
@307  = ~(snort!) Even now, in this very moment!...~
@308  = ~Let us move on.~
@309  = ~Attention? I thought I am conversing in a normal manner... But as you wish, I will stop telling my mind like a fool!~
@310  = ~I didn't mean it like that. I just don't want to talk right now.~
@311  = ~What a wonderful idea. Please stick to it in the future!~
@312  = ~Hmph. These weapons are nothing compared to what the drow smiths are making.~ [c#ablank]
@313  = ~I had some weapons from the surface back in the Underdark, but I never really used them. They didn't compare with the ones we used normally.~
@314  = ~I am sorry that our weapons displease you.~
@315  = ~I beg your pardon? Our weapons are by no means that bad.~
@316  = ~Don't be silly. Our weapons might be forged differently, but they aren't poorer than drow weapons.~
@317  = ~How about: 'A weapon is as good as the one wielding it', hm?~
@318  = ~Except for the tiny little fact that they'll all turn to dust if exposed to the sun?~
@319  = ~Drow, keep your mouth and spare me your whining in the future!~
@320  = ~Forgive me. You equipped me with weapons and armor, and I should be thankful for it.~
@321  = ~That was a matter of course.~
@322  = ~In return you are fighting for me.~
@323  = ~You are handling them well, Solaufein. Your fighting prowess is great.~
@324  = ~It's weapons I have no other use for, Solaufein.~
@325  = ~Hmph. Are you trying to make fun of me?~
@326  = ~(snort!) Well, weapons do increase my fighting prowess significantly.~
@327  = ~You are admitting it?~
@328  = ~Pah! I'm lamenting like an old male. We lingered long enough.~
@329  = ~I... I spoke ill of our weapons recently. I know it is not my place to do so. And that it is foolish considering what would happen with my high regarded drow weapons if exposed to the light!~ [c#ablank]
@330  = ~Thank you for admitting this, Solaufein.~
@331  = ~You would fare well with a little less arrogance, you know.~
@332  = ~Just stop whining, and everything will be fine.~
@333  = ~Even I am able to realize when I'm making a fool of myself.~
@334  = ~You are right to scold me. I am... lamenting about things that are unchangeable and which I chose myself.~
@335  = ~Also, it isn't... true that I would despise them so much. On the contrary. Maybe they aren't as mighty as some I wielded in the Underdark, but they *are* made of durable material.~
@336  = ~It is the reason surfacer items always fascinated me - they seamed to be different. More blunt... and yet more real. Even the writing, on paper made to endure sunlight.~
@337  = ~You mentioned writing? Did you have some from the surface?~
@338  = ~Where from did you get your surfacer items?~
@339  = ~Aha. Let us move on.~
@340  = ~Yes. Drow attach importance to the education of their young. We were teached everything that would increase our capability to act. I wasn't only teached your tongue, but also your lettering.~
@341  = ~There are merchants coming into the Underdark. But mostly... the items were not given to me, <CHARNAME>. I paid them with blood.~
@342  = ~Mostly, they originated from raids from the surface I did as a young male. Later, I didn't need them to impress my matron, but I went nontheless. It was the only possibility to get to the surface and... receive information.~
@343  = ~Tell me about these raids, Solaufein. I always thought their only reason would be to bring chaos and destruction to the surface.~
@344  = ~*You* participated on raids to the surface?! Innocent people were murdered!~
@345  = ~Well, that is what the surfacers see, and it's indeed intended. One important reason young males go on raids to the surface is to impress their matron, however. Going there is very dangerous for us drow. Anyone managing to come back with a... trophy proves his courage and fighting prowess.~
@346  = ~What kind of 'trophy' are we talking here?~
@347  = ~The actual trophies were... surfacer heads, other proof of their deaths, or alive ones for the slave pits - for the honor of Lolth~
@348  = ~Did you bring... 'trophies' yourself, too?~
@349  = ~You are different than other drow, Solaufein.~
@350  = ~Of course I have!~
@351  = ~What do you expect? I am drow! Do you think my weapons were never soaked in surfacer blood?! <PRO_RACE> or other surfacer races, it didn't matter. Wasn't this plain to you when you allowed me into your group? How do you think I was raised by my people?!~
@352  = ~It would be foolish of you to forget about this. Better keep it in mind, and reevaluate whether you want me around!~
@353  = ~I swore myself never to be so uncautious as I was there at the entrance of the silver dragon's lair. Imrae got me even though I was vigilant... I was supposed to become a drider! Only thanks to you I am here now, unscarthed.~ [c#ablank]
@354  = ~I see why this would be frustrating.~
@355  = ~You will be better prepared next time.~
@356  = ~It all went well, though.~
@357  = ~You should watch out something like this never happens again. It would endanger not only you but us all.~
@358  = ~Ha! Better prepared? Where, here?!~
@359  = ~Went well?! Having to cut me out of a drider cocoon you would call 'went well'?~
@360  = ~You did not understand what I was saying. I swore to myself never to be so unprepared - and now I am here.~
@361  = ~Would a Handmaiden of Lolth caught up with me *here*, she still empowered with the magic from the Underdark whereas I so weakened - I wouldn't have the slightest chance!~
@362  = ~If you expect me to fight with high prowess, then it was a mistake to bring me here to the surface. I am a drow, trained for the most enduring of fights. But here, my strength is drained by the sun every day more!~
@363  = ~I draw peace from the knowledge that the Handmaidens have more important things to do than to hunt for renegates - if they emerge to the surface at all.~
@364  = ~(snort!) Well, for that they have their little helpers, the servants of the drider queen...~
@365  = ~I did not exaggerate when saying that the sun takes the strength out of me, <CHARNAME>. I am able to wield a weapon, and sometimes even manage to hit a foe, if he is standing near anough...~ [c#ablank]
@366  = ~But my magic seems to have vanished. What is left is a meager resemblance of the magic I was able to wield in the Underdark. So... it is indeed true...~
@367  = ~What do you mean by 'it is true'?~
@368  = ~Would it help if we returned to the Underdark for a while?~
@369  = ~Seems the drow magic is connected to the Underdark.~
@370  = ~You said this already recently. Did it get worse?~
@371  = ~Don't bother. I need you as a fighter, nothing more.~
@372  = ~From childhood on the Handmaidens tell us that we drow are only strong in the Underdark, in the spider queen's realm. I never doubted that we would be more exposed and therefore more threatened at the surface, but just how much drow are weakened, I completely underestimated.~
@373  = ~I do not know what gives me more unease: That my magic diminshed as much as it did... or that I have to agree to what *Handmaidens* proclaimed.~
@374  = ~You'll be fine.~
@375  = ~Many a drow might have returned remorsefully to the spider queen's realm after experiencing this weakness on the surface. Many a renegate might have doubted Eilistraee's words in the blinding light and hotness of the sun...~
@376  = ~I... I mean to be strong. Nothing bothers me more than Drizzt's words that the sun would not be my foe. I don't understand them!~
@377  = ~I'm not telling you merely to lament about my fate, <CHARNAME>. My words heed a warning as well. No longer I am one of the strong drow you know from the Underdark. I might be a capable fighter, still... Yes, as a fighter and mule I might still serve well.~
@378  = ~By Eilistraee! You want to lead me back into the Unterdark while I try to leave the spider queen's realm behind me? No, if it is the gods' will then I will be weak, here at the surface!~
@379  = ~And even if, I doubt you would want to wait the time it would take my magic to recover. I, at least, would have no wish to remain that long!~
@380  = ~Indeed. Our whole existence is because we gave ourselves to the spider queen in the deep darkness. It is only of consequent that we would lose most of it if returning to the surface.~
@381  = ~No... But it didn't improve, either.~
@382  = ~(snort!) I can only as much as guess why you would have me come with you, <CHARNAME>. Are you content with what I became?~ [c#ablank]
@383  = ~What do you mean?~
@384  = ~Yes, I am.~
@385  = ~No, I'm not.~
@386  = ~I'm having you with me because I think you are worth it.~
@387  = ~I lost my magic, I am blind for most of the day, my concentration is strained by all the unused sounds and sights around us, I still am not entirely firm with my new weapons, and my appearance raises hostility wherever we go.~
@388  = ~I am sorry you are feeling so insecure and unsafe, Solaufein.~
@389  = ~That's a fitting list.~
@390  = ~Good graceous, calm down!~
@391  = ~You think so?!~
@392  = ~I am not surprised!~
@393  = ~There are only two possibilies I can think of why you would do such a thing. The first is that you welcome my weakness and rejoice about the tamed monster at your side.~
@394  = ~Or maybe you are more naive and kind hearted than I imagined possible, and might even feel responsible for my well being!~
@395  = ~Hmph. The way I see you behave I fear it is the latter. You seem to believe you can overcome your foes with kindness. I guess I am the best example that you succeed, indeed!~
@396  = ~Not your empathy on top of it all!~
@397  = ~Isn't it?!~
@398  = ~<CHARNAME>, I regret the words I spoke to you, they put me in shame. I *am* thankful to you for rescuing me and taking me into your group. Your ways of living and interacting is... unfamiliar, but not unpleasant. I spoke in anger.~ [c#ablank]
@399  = ~Then tell me what angered you so, Solaufein.~
@400  = ~You owe me an explanation, I would say.~
@401  = ~I don't care, Solaufein. Best you stop confiding in me altogether, then I won't have to listen to any of your insults again.~
@402  = ~Perhaps you can relate, <CHARNAME>. My senses are very dulled, still. They don't recover as fast as I thought... as fast as I had hoped - in my naivite...~
@403  = ~And that is why you are angry?~
@404  = ~I can relate to your frustration.~
@405  = ~You are a lot of things, but naive isn't one of them, Solaufein.~
@406  = ~Naive, indeed.~
@407  = ~It seems I tend to hope against all odds... Only weeks ago I would have called myself completely naive for my dream of leaving the Underdark forever.~
@408  = ~I am angry about my shortcomings... and my impatience because of it.~
@409  = ~I am drow. Only recently, I was part of a society of merciless hirarchy, with punishments as frequently as well deadly.~
@410  = ~But I am here now, and my refelexes are becoming slower, my senses aren't that sharp any more, my eyes still blinded by the sunlight. I feel myself weaken and becoming an easy target, my fighting prowess dwindling. This is not good!~
@411  = ~I can't agree to that description. You are fighting well.~
@412  = ~That is exactly why we all combined forces. So we can have each other's backs!~
@413  = ~Well now. If it is as you say, then it would be alarming, indeed.~
@414  = ~You should focus on keeping your fighting prowess up, or I won't have much use of you any more.~
@415  = ~I still demand you to keep your anger at bay. It's the least I can expect!~
@416  = ~I am! Be assured, that is what I am doing.~
@417  = ~(snort!) I'm lamenting like an old male. I should keep my mouth shut, least you decide to get rid of me like the drow do with their old and useless males!~
@418  = ~I guess it will take a while until my mind will be at ease up here... if it ever was. Until then, I fear you will have to bear with my temper.~
@419  = ~It doesn't change the fact that my fighting prowess is diminished compared to what it once was... And that getting *better* should be the aim here.~
@420  = ~Indeed, and I appreciate your support.~
@421  = ~You mean my current behavior contradicts to how I was raised to behave as a drow male? Yes, I guess you are right. But the whole situation of my current life contradicts the way I lived before!~
@422  = ~We are travelling as companions for a while now, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@423  = ~I appreciate how you treat those that seek our help along the way.~
@424  = ~And also, the interest you show in me during or should I better say despite my constant lamenting flatters me endlessly. I have to say it: Your actions are an ideal I enjoy taking examples of.~
@425  = ~(snort!) So, and now it's your turn to tell me that you never intended to take such a weakling into your group and that I am no longer the drow you met in Ust Natha. And you would be right, but I... I am strangely content about it.~
@426  = ~That you have no interest in me sharing my constant lamenting with you is very understandable. It is unfortunate, of course, from my perspective. But I can't blame you for it. I will take example of how you treat others, though.~
@427  = ~No, you got that wrong. I am interested in you indeed, but not always there is time to share a lengthy conversation.~
@428  = ~Do what you want, and do it quietly. I didn't take you along for talking.~
@429  = ~Indeed? If this is the case, then I am content.~
@430  = ~I got that, <CHARNAME>.~
@431  = ~You are friendly to me, but the way you act towards other does not always show this charitableness. You are indeed interested in your own profit if dealing with others. I have to assume that this is the reason you are friendly to me, as well.~
@432  = ~No, Solaufein. I truly like you.~
@433  = ~My experince taught me to judge others by their deeds, not their words, <CHARNAME>. Converse with me whenever you want. But I will not take example of the way you treat others seeking our help.~
@434  = ~Well, there is no use talking around it. Your behavior towards others makes it very clear it is your own advantage you seek.~
@435  = ~Also, you did not show any interest for my concerns. Not that I could blame you for that, though.~
@436  = ~But just as much I do not see a reason to feel overly attached to you. I will stay in your group, however, as long as you find me useful. What comes after, we will have to see.~
@437  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm not sure... (growls).~ [c#sola10] 
@438  = ~What?~
@439  = ~I something wrong?~
@440  = ~I don't want to hear any more from you, Solaufein. Get back in line and be quiet!~
@441  = ~You mean I won't have to deal with your perpetual friendlyness any more? That is... good.~
@442  = ~Definitely.~
@443  = ~I was turning my back to you. Did you notice?~
@444  = ~Er, no?~
@445  = ~Yes, I did.~
@446  = ~What of it?~
@447  = ~I didn't notice right away. You were behins my back, and I couldn't see you at all times!~
@448  = ~So?~
@449  = ~Do you have to see me at all times?~
@450  = ~What is your point? Make it quick.~
@451  = ~Not if you are away far enough. Don't you see what I mean?~
@452  = ~It is exactly what we talked about only recently! I didn't keep an eye on you... Only for a small instant, but it would have sufficed for you to use the moment and kill me, and it was I who gave you the opportunity! I'm growing weak! I'm losing my vigilance, my fighting power, everything that once defined me!~
@453  = ~No, spare your words. Do not comment on this! Neither do I wish to be rebuked by you nor get one of your unbelievable comforting comments of understanding!~
@454  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>. Do you wish to know why I was so short with you as of late?~ [c#ablank]
@455  = ~Yes, please tell me what is bothering you.~
@456  = ~Is this the beginning of an apology?~
@457  = ~No, not really, to be honest.~
@458  = ~You want me to keep quiet, then? That we stop sharing our thoughts?~
@459  = ~No, please speak, if it is important to you.~
@460  = ~Yes, please! You are fighting alongside me, and that's it. I am not interested in your 'conversations'.~
@461  = ~That... it might very well be.~
@462  = ~That I would turn my back to you - unconsciously, do you understand why it scared me so much?~
@463  = ~Because you fear that your vigilance is diminished?~
@464  = ~Because you don't trust me?~
@465  = ~No, I don't know.~
@466  = ~It is no surprise you would suspect this to be the cause, as frequently as I spoke about it.~
@467  = ~Ha! If only...~
@468  = ~I was concerned my reduced vigilance would decrease my chances of survival - although no longer being between drow, but here with you.~
@469  = ~But it is not only my diminished prowess that concerns me. It is also my... feelings.~
@470  = ~Your way of living, of treating one another - the friendly words and geastures, the trust you grant each other... At the beginning, I was thrilled. It filled me like a rush, it felt like being on a surge of excitement. I was willing to endure the disadvantages the sun and being away from the Underdark bestowed on me. I knew I had to pay a price, and expected to adjust to it after some time.~
@471  = ~Well my weakness consists, as you well know. But... this alone wouldn't be such a problem, had I not the impression that I would *actively* work on intensifying them!~
@472  = ~I notice myself participating in your friendly ways. I am... relaxing - even though my physical restrictions still persist, my mind seems to come to ease, as absurd as this sounds. My vigilance is lacking. I am turning myself into easy prey if I don't watch out!~
@473  = ~My harsh words resulted from a sudden feeling of... uncertainty. I felt like being knocked off my feet. To be here is far more overwhelming than I would have ever expected, <CHARNAME>.~
@474  = ~You are starting to trust in others, Solaufein.~
@475  = ~You are not alone. We'll have your back.~
@476  = ~You said several times that you do enjoy the friendly ways and are glad not to have to watch your back all the time. And now all of a sudden it would be too much?~
@477  = ~Is lamenting all you are capable of?~
@478  = ~Is it not understandable that there can be a great difference between an idea and actually living it? I have to surpress many of my instincts to be so close to you. The other half of my vigilance is occupied with the restrictions due to the sun. It is exhausting!~
@479  = ~Trust? Drizzt mentioned trust... as a base for friendship.~
@480  = ~Everything that is happening currently feels like the weakening of my self. If this is the prerequisit for living between you surfacers, then it is a bad thing! Do I have to lose trust into my own abilities before being able to learn the friendly way of interacting? What sense would that make?~
@481  = ~You will understand once you are ready to trust in others.~
@482  = ~A lot, Solaufein. Trusting others means putting part of your wellbeing into their hands.~
@483  = ~None, but that's how it is.~
@484  = ~We talked long enough about your feelings.~
@485  = ~Well, I *had* that in the past, and I didn't like it at all!~
@486  = ~I expected difficulties to give in to trust. I was not, however, prepared that it would feel as if I'd have to give up every bit of my self-understanding.~
@487  = ~It shouldn't surprise you. You are working against being conditioned to mistrust for centuries.~
@488  = ~That's not what it takes. You'll have to change your self-understanding, is all.~
@489  = ~I expect not to let go of my last bit of self respect and vigilance just because being overwhelmed like a toddler!~
@490  = ~I told you, because you are my leader and should know how I am.~
@491  = ~Also, you *are* my mentor for living at the surface... Whether you like it, or not.~
@492  = ~Is all? You speak of great achievements with great confidence. There is no magic of a wyrm backing up my attempt of assimilation, <CHARNAME>!~
@493  = ~I... had an inner struggle these past time, <CHARNAME>. I thought I could ignore and wait for my peoccupation to pass, but my recent behavior makes it very clear that this is no option.~ [c#ablank]
@494  = ~Do you have an idea what I considered last night? I pondered about which of my abilities is still at full strength. One discipline which does not suffer from my diminished prowess. Where my century long drill would pay off because I could still impress you, despite my pathetic condition.~
@495  = ~I searched for the one thing I would be better trained at and could better perform than any surfacer. And the only thing coming to my mind, the only thing I think would fit this description, is the lust services we males are trained at beginning from childhood so we are able to satisfy our Matron Mothers. The lust services!~
@496  = ~I distaste nothig more than these! But I seriously did consider offering them to you - so you'd have to agree that I am better than any of your lovers... better than you. So you would have to pay respect to my skilled performance...~
@497  = ~This was the moment I realized I have to open up and tell you how I feel, or I will lose my mind. Will you listen?~
@498  = ~...Lust services?~
@499  = ~You do not have to prove anything to me!~
@500  = ~Of course, Solaufein, speak!~
@501  = ~No, I do not care about your problems. Be quiet and stop annoying me with them.~
@502  = ~Yes, lust services, but that is not what I wanted to talk to you about. Please, will you let me speak?~
@503  = ~Of course, Solaufein, speak!~
@504  = ~Only, if you tell me about your idea concerning the lust services again, Solaufein.~
@505  = ~Not to you - it was me I needed to prove something. I need your... guidance.~
@506  = ~Young <PRO_RACE>, I do not seek your physical intimacy. It does not mean to me what it seems to mean to you surfacers. It is a connection... of minds I am looking for.~
@507  = ~I spoke recently and told you about my difficulty to give in to trust...~
@508  = ~Denying doesn't work. Trying to either keeping my mind from it or ridiculing it only increased my confusion. Because the strongest feeling filling me, shaking my drow self to the grounds of its very being, is the connection, the closeness I feel towards you, <CHARNAME>.~
@509  = ~Do you hear me, strong <PRO_RACE>? Never I have spoken like this to anyone.~
@510  = ~Connection? What exactly do you mean with that?~
@511  = ~Is this a love confession?~
@512  = ~Then maybe you shouldn't start talking like this now.~
@513  = ~I do not wish to hear any more, Solaufein. Get back in line.~
@514  = ~Love? For your surfacers, this term includes physical closeness if used for non-related adults. Do you know how old I am? How young you are in comparison? No, this is not what I am looking for.~
@515  = ~I feel safe in your presence. Safe, and... comfortable. I do not startle if you take steps towards me. I turn my back towards you - without even noticing.~
@516  = ~I feel a strange urge for you to acknowledge my feelings. Not because I expect advantages for myself from it, but because I want you to feel in a similar way towards me.~
@517  = ~Why am I putting myself into such dependence from you if all I aim for is independence and being able to prevail on my own? Does it make any sense?~
@518  = ~You are seeking friendship. This is what you are feeling.~
@519  = ~Solaufein, it was a love declaration. Admit it!~
@520  = ~I hear you babbling, weakling, and I am appalled. I might have enjoyed you as a lover, but this I have no use for. Get a grib on yourself!~
@521  = ~I have difficulties to apprehend your definition of love, <CHARNAME>. It includes physical aspects I woud never combine with it myself. It claimes the other person to oneself in a possessive way that I don't wish for myself. No, it was no love declaration as you see it.~
@522  = ~Is there no chance at all to win your heart?~
@523  = ~Of all things! I can't believe how you can open your heart to me the way you did and then shy away from the last, logical step. Keep your thoughts to yourself from now on!~
@524  = ~Friendship... Yes, I think you are right. It is a mental kind of connection I am yearning for. Like a gawping child I take in everything I see from this life while in your presence... What a fool I am!~
@525  = ~Why do you call yourself a fool?~
@526  = ~You are not a fool, Solaufein! I would be happy to call you my friend.~
@527  = ~If feel like a fool, maybe you should keep your mouth shut in the future!~
@528  = ~But you have it already! You have it right in your hands. I opened my heart to you like I never did before to anyone. Only what you call love - boundless devotion, physical commitment - this I cannot give you!~
@529  = ~Hrmph. Not even the cruel Handmaidens had the power to shut me up just like that.~
@530  = ~I had hoped differently, but if this is what you wish, then so shall it be.~
@531  = ~But I will show you my respect and be quiet from now on, as you wish.~
@532  = ~Is this true? Then... then I will be your friend. I am proud a surfacer calls me so.~
@533  = ~I am drow... what else than a fool am I if thinking that I could have friends?~
@534  = ~I was quite harsh in some of our earlier conversations. Knowing you are calling yourself my friend, I feel ashamed when thinking about it.~ [c#ablank]
@535  = ~(snort!) I can call myself lucky you took to me the way you did, it seems...~
@536  = ~But still I have difficulties to understand what is going on. My behavior is that of an old male with nothing to lose, musing about life, chatting with you pleasantly... I am drow, and as weak as I am currently, my people would have killed me long before!~
@537  = ~In the world I know it would be a big mistake to tell you as much as I did about myself. To give away one's private thoughts is equal to let your flank unprotected in a fight - it weakens oneself and gives the opponent the possibility to cause much damage! How can I be sure you won't use it against me someday?~
@538  = ~You really think I would take advantage of you in this way? I am not like that!~
@539  = ~You need to trust me, Solaufein. That's how friendship works.~
@540  = ~And even if - are you that weak that you need to be afraid of it?~
@541  = ~Solaufein! Please spare me this whining.~
@542  = ~You are right, I am whining. You are a strong <PRO_RACE>, <CHARNAME>. Forgive me my weakness, I won't lose control again.~
@543  = ~I didn't imply that I expect you to take advantage. I am trying to accustome myself to your way of living, but it is not that easy! I feel torn apart between the feeling of friendship I so desperately want to give in to, and the pure mistrust which secured my survival the past centuries.~
@544  = ~But you... you are *chatting* with me as if I wouldn't mean any danger to you! How can you be sure that *I* will not betray *you* one day, <CHARNAME>?~
@545  = ~I don't, but I trust you.~
@546  = ~In case this happens I will be prepared!~
@547  = ~We will see how things go, Solaufein. Everyone's behavior is also dependent on the circumstances. Sometimes, even friends betray each other.~
@548  = ~I have no intention of betraying you, <CHARNAME>. But I am drow, so your take on it is justified. I am only trying to make it clear that you *should* not trst me. One can never know which foolishness you credulous surfacers are up to next!~
@549  = ~But I do trust you, Solaufein! It's how friendship works.~
@550  = ~How lucky I am to have you foresightful drow with me then, eh?~
@551  = ~I see that you are serious about it although I do not understand why. Why do you trust me, the drow? Did you not listen to what I said? Did you not witness how we drow deal with trust? Trusting me still you seem to be more naive than I thought!~
@552  = ~What has it to do with you how 'the drow' are doing things?~
@553  = ~I saw how *you* are dealing with trust, and that is what matters.~
@554  = ~Well... I see what you mean.~
@555  = ~Your cordiality remains unchanged.~
@556  = ~Not long ago I would have spat in front of your feet. But now I am most grateful for your friendly words.~
@557  = ~It is... a complete new experience to be surrounded by friendly faces, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@558  = ~There weren't that many in In Ust Natha, I take it?~
@559  = ~It must be horrible.~
@560  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Solaufein.~
@561  = ~Horrible? Although I think that I understand what you are aiming at I still would rather call the time I left behind 'horrible'.~
@562  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, none. Well, there was one, once... But it vanished a long time ago.~
@563  = ~...Phaere?~
@564  = ~Do you want to talk about it?~
@565  = ~Yes - Phaere.~
@566  = ~I mentioned recently how your surfacer's laughing surprised and still fascinates me. I am referring to the one I never heard from my kind, the friendly, jolly one...~
@567  = ~With Phaere I almost would have laughed like that. Almost...~
@568  = ~But that is a story that is long over and in the past.~
@569  = ~Tell me about you and Phaere.~
@570  = ~I don't want to hear old stories.~
@571  = ~I told you Phaere and I were in love once. Well, do not mistake the term for what you surfcers mean by it.~
@572  = ~That I, the male, had to be of service to her, the oldest daughter of the house Despana, was self-evident. No, our love manifested itself in her protecting me from most of the cruelest reprisals... and that I could talk to her without having to weigh every word, without having to fear to be punished for every careless remark. It was a situation unthinkable for a drow male.~
@573  = ~Some of the indications you just mentioned are rather unsettling.~
@574  = ~Sounds like an exciting relationship.~
@575  = ~Please, go on.~
@576  = ~Solaufein, I do not wish to hear the details.~
@577  = ~Do you think so? And yet I am telling about something wonderful, <CHARNAME>.~
@578  = ~She could trust me. Never I would have harmed her in any way...~
@579  = ~...Upon returning from the hand maidens' punishment, her behavior towards me was cruel even for drow standarts. My house had to step in... We became prisoners in this destructive impasse. The protection of my house, keeping me safe from lethal cruelty, was at the same time the curse that binded me to my services to the house Despana.~
@580  = ~As the male who I am I could be glad for this outcome, as I came out of it without further... consequences. I closed myself to her reprisals, carried out her orders and concentrated on my status as a male warrior. But that was at the outside. On the inside... I found to my Lady Eilistraee and do believe like her that my race strayed from the right path.~
@581  = ~Do you want to hear the whole story?~
@582  = ~Are you kidding? That's what I was waiting for the whole time!~
@583  = ~I thought this was the long version, but yes, go ahaed.~
@584  = ~I was her favorite male. Maybe the traces of opportunism I showed even then pleased her. I still believed myself to be a child of the spider queen then, but I lacked the will to play the game of intrigue to gain small advantages. I think she noticed this and liked it, back then.~
@585  = ~She kept me close by, and our contact was... friendlier than common. I was a strong male, protected by an influencial house. A good choice, so to say. We spent time together, just we two. We liked being with each other. It was, for drow, a very uncommon and dangerous exclusivity...~
@586  = ~The seclusiveness of our relation did not go unnoticed. House Despana decided it went far beyond what was appropriate for drow. But they could not punish me, my house did not withdraw my protection - nothing inappropriate had happened but Matron Mother Ardulace being worried about the authority and leadership abilities of her eldest daughter. And so she sent the Maiden's to Phaere.~
@587  = ~They rid her of any feelings of goodwill towards me. Phaere understood perfectly well why she got punished so cruelly, and had no restraint to let me feel it afterwards. Oh, how much she yearned for the possibility to take her revenge out on me in a final way! But my status as a male was too high and my house was too powerful, so we were both damned to live on.~
@588  = ~I gained the status as a leader in the male fighting guild not much later, after putting all my efforts into my training and my services to Lolth out of mere lack of alternatives. You might have called it devastation. Back then, all I knew is that I lost the huge advantage of having the favor of a first daughter of a powerful house - and that life would be much more difficult.~
@589  = ~It was much later before I faced the fact that it was more that got lost.. For me, and I do not know but I assume for Phaere, too. I concentrated on her as a partner in a way it is unfeasible for a drow. We male live to serve the higher ranked female... Many of my brethren would do anything to impress and be noticed by one of the higher daughters and maton mothers, but to favor one of them? To enjoy being near her, without aim or reason?... Unthinkable.~
@590  = ~My life got much more complicated after that. I was disappointed and disillusioned, and still alive out of mere luck. She who meant so much to me before was now my sworn enemy. It was but a matter of time until I realized my internal conflict and ambivalence and turned towards my Lady Eilistraee with the silver hair.~
@591  = ~It was in this time that I lead an ambush to the surface. I remember very well how I stood there, looking at the light that foretold the sunrise, and how I considered to run - run into the wrong direction, towards the rising sun...~
@592  = ~But I did not do that. I settled myself into my new life, functioning as a minion to the power seeking females, staying away from everything that was not crucial to secure my position.~
@593  = ~I'm glad you did! Otherwise, you wouldn't have been in Ust Natha still when I went there.~
@594  = ~I... was embittered and weary of my own life. I distasted the drow... For the evil deeds they do. For the evil deeds I did.~
@595  = ~I almost longed for you to kill me. But while still talking to you in the male fighter's guild I felt something sparking inside of me, touching my soul, filling me with a tremor of anticipation. Until then I was convinced I had no other choice but to accept my fate. In that moment, though, I realized that there is another way.~
@596  = ~You opened a window in my heart, <CHARNAME>. It surprises me how strong the feelings are coming through it - and also, that I... am talking to you about them.~
@597  = ~And now I am here with you. I thank the Lady with the Silver Hair that it came to be like this. And I thank you, <CHARNAME>, for being able to make first experiences as a... 'surfacer' under your protection.~
@598  = ~This is the whole story. I thank you for your patience. It felt good, telling it all for once.~
@599  = ~I watched you in our last fight, <CHARNAME>. You fight very well. You know how to handle your profession.~ [c#ablank]
@600  = ~Thank you, Solaufein.~
@601  = ~You mean your impression that we were 'weaklings' you had to take care of on top of everything else was not confirmed, hm?~
@602  = ~I don't like these compliments, Solaufein. I know myself that I'm good, I've proven it often enough.~
@603  = ~I'm not familiar with talking like this.~
@604  = ~For a drow, insulting others is the normal tone. I think with... with a slight shudder at the way I 'greeted' you in Ust Natha.~
@605  = ~Why?~
@606  = ~Haha, yes, the greeting was hilarious. Grounded me instantly with regard to the common courtesies.~
@607  = ~Do you feel your style of talking is different now?~
@608  = ~Let us move on.~
@609  = ~And yet you did show some behavior that could have betrayed you.~
@610  = ~You're right to reprimand me. I'm not familiar with your kind of making conversation.~
@611  = ~Did that offend you?~
@612  = ~Since at least the time you spared my life. But even before that.~
@613  = ~When you apologized for me being punished because of you. That was a very drow-untypical act! At first I was afraid you were too weak for what was waiting for us. But then I suddenly had another feeling. Your words touched me curiously. At that moment I looked at you with different eyes, <CHARNAME>.~
@614  = ~Something about you was different. You didn't... cave in when Phaere shooed you. As if you had one more card to play. As if you still had other options.~
@615  = ~But it never aroused my suspicions. I had the feeling I was meeting someone like-minded. But duty called, and there was no time to discuss my feelings... And then when Phaere called us in again - (sigh) the feeling was forgotten. That witch! It makes me sad to think that she was once different, that I once had that feeling in her presence. And I still shudder to think what Lolth's Handmaidens did to her to destroy it...~
@616  = ~But Phaere gave me enough opportunity to loathe her in the decades that followed. Pah! My words are idle gossip. Let's not talk about it anymore. Let me just say that my opinion of you has changed considerably. In... in every sense.~
@617  = ~To travel with you here and now overwhelms me, <CHARNAME>. And I... note every one of your surfacers' friendly gestures that so often occur in your normal interactions. I must seem surly and withdrawn in comparison.~
@618  = ~Because it seems so disproportionately contemptuous now. I don't want to talk like that anymore. Not if I don't know who I'm talking to. Or even do know the person - and have high regards for <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@619  = ~Absolutely! Or when was the last time I called you a fool, you fool?~
@620  = ~Although I must admit I deliberately chose unkind words. I had been waiting for this group from Ched Nassad for a long time, the window of opportunity for Phaere's rescue was getting tighter and tighter, and when you finally arrived... you looked like a bunch of kids unfitting for their armor.~
@621  = ~In retrospect, I think that I had only misinterpreted your insecurity, because I was soon able to experience your outstanding fighting prowess. But when you stood in front of me, I saw in you only a bunch of young inexperienced drow, who wanted to test their fighting skills and would give their lives for a self-righteous task of a Matron Mother or Handmaiden of Lolth...~
@622  = ~Since my well-being was linked to the successful completion of the task, I simply hoped that you could fight well. That's all I saw in you at first.~
@623  = ~That's understandable, you didn't know me then.~
@624  = ~I guess that impression has changed?~
@625  = ~That was probably a good thing. It made our impersonation last longer.~
@626  = ~I don't want to hear about it in so much detail, Solaufein.~
@627  = ~But I would not have thought it possible either to what our acquaintance has developed into, had someone told me.~
@628  = ~What I said to you the other day wasn't meant as a simple compliment, <CHARNAME>. To curry favor with someone is not what I do. I really can only admire your fighting style. You have to know that for us, the drow, you surfacers always seem soft at first...~ [c#ablank]
@629  = ~This is due to the friendly manners you cultivate with each other. A drow with these manners wouldn't survive the day.~
@630  = ~You already said something of that sort.~
@631  = ~Traveling with us seems a great challenge for you, Solaufein.~
@632  = ~Are you sure? You have to be friendly towards your Matron Mother, haven't you?~
@633  = ~Maybe. Let's move on.~
@634  = ~Not like this. Polite, submissive, yes. But not friendly. Not in the sense that I meant. For drow, friendlyness, gentleness is a weakness. I start to realize that this is not necessarily true.~
@635  = ~That is true.~
@636  = ~That's right! Did you conclude this just now, or did you draw on my innumerable lamentations of recent times?...~
@637  = ~Let me explain this... When I was young, your customs were foreign to me. I thought you were weak and gullible... For a drow to trust equals to be betrayed.~
@638  = ~Later I realized that you are strong precisely because of this trust and the community that you form amongst yourselves. I learned to respect your surfacers' way.~
@639  = ~And now I am here... and I envy you for it.~
@640  = ~You are part of such a society now as well.~
@641  = ~Well, considering you are a drow, this kind of society will probably always be closed to you.~
@642  = ~I am drow. It is not only my past that makes me one, but also my appearance betrays me, and I will never be able to rid myself of it. You are kind to me, but will you and your kind ever consider me as one of you? I dare to doubt it.~
@643  = ~I trust you. Everything else is up to you.~
@644  = ~As much as it is possible under the current conditions. You can't change your looks, as you said yourself, but how people react to you will also be influenced by how you treat them and behave yourself.~
@645  = ~You don't seriously expect that, do you? You are drow after all.~
@646  = ~That's only too true.~
@647  = ~I am and will remain drow... at least for other people.~
@648  = ~And yet I have changed. To my kin I'm already nothing more but spider food...~
@649  = ~There is only so much I can do to influence how others will treat me. There will always be the ones who draw a weapon first and ask questions later.~
@650  = ~Well, I am used to that. But here on the surface, people would have so many possibilities to do it differently...~
@651  = ~Well, as would have the drow, I guess - if one would manage to get them from their wrong path!~
@652  = ~You... just say it like that! I sense that you mean it... I can only shake my head in disbelief!~
@653  = ~I... would like to tell you something, <CHARNAME>. I told you that slaves taught me your language. Well, that wasn't a lie. The situation, however, was that rather *one* slave girl served me as a teacher... Do you want to hear the story behind it?~ [c#ablank]
@654  = ~Sure, tell me.~
@655  = ~I fear the worst, but yes, I would like to hear it.~
@656  = ~I don't want to hear that, Solaufein.~
@657  = ~She was granted to me as a play slave because of services with which I had pleased the Matron Mother of my house. Well, in general, play slaves do not survive long. Their purpose is to please in whichever perversities their mistresses and masters think out for them, and often they die while doing so...~
@658  = ~Solaufein - on second thought, I'd rather not listen to that.~
@659  = ~Even then, I found no pleasure in carrying out senseless cruelty. Her fear and helplessness disgusted me. But instead of killing her or give her to the Handmaidens, I spared her life.~
@660  = ~I began to see her as a teacher of your language, and soon we practiced almost every day. I never touched her. To my surprise, her eagerness to serve as my teacher increased with passing time.~
@661  = ~It was a noteworthy experience, <CHARNAME>: To realize that humans are even more ready at one's service because they do *not* get threatened with punishment. It was... a small but extremely fascinating glimmer of your surface life that I perceived there.~
@662  = ~Yes, that must have been extraordinary.~
@663  = ~You could only experience it because you showed her mercy.~
@664  = ~The whole situation was strange. I never experienced myself like this.~
@665  = ~But I couldn't protect her. Phaere - still my intimate then - discovered us and killed her. She did it for my protection. I was like obsessed. Had a Handmaiden of Lolth discovered us, my fate would have been cruel.~
@666  = ~Did you love that woman, Solaufein?~
@667  = ~You left that time behind you.~
@668  = ~I feel very sorry for the woman, but maybe she were better off than some others down there.~
@669  = ~I thank you for the trust you bestow upon me by telling something so personal about your past, Solaufein.~
@670  = ~That is horrible!~
@671  = ~Do you love the dog that licks your hand?~
@672  = ~I felt something for that woman, something inappropriate and dangerous for a drow. But what do you call love? I was enthralled by the situation, our hidden game fascinated me - because of the forbidden treasures I found with it.~
@673  = ~She had a painless and quick death. Many slaves of the drow pray to their gods for this mercy.~
@674  = ~I will prove to you that the cruel rules of the Underdark no longer have power over me, <CHARNAME>. I... wanted to tell you this because I thought it might be of interest to you.~
@675  = ~Very well.~
@676  = ~And I listened.~
@677  = ~I... thank you for these kind and sensitive words. Yes, I'm still not used to talking like that.~
@678  = ~<CHARNAME>, I saw the slaves you sent to the exit. It was you who sent them to their freedom, wasn't it?~ [c#ablank]
@679  = ~Yes, that was me.~
@680  = ~Where did you see them?~
@681  = ~Is it important?~
@682  = ~On their way to the exit. By that time, I was already hiding in the shadows myself, so I only watched them briefly.~
@683  = ~If it is not important to you that you set them free, then that is your decision. But the sight of them made me ponder.~
@684  = ~Why so?~
@685  = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@686  = ~It was very gracious of you. They were... of lower quality. They probably would have ended as spider food.~
@687  = ~They were poorly equipped.~
@688  = ~You had them exceptionally well equipped. Not for the mission they were meant to accomplish, but in comparison to their... quality.~
@689  = ~It's a wonder the gatekeepers haven't become suspicious. The chaos due to the war has made a lot possible.~
@690  = ~Not everyone got through, but...~
@691  = ~It weren't only the strongest and bravest that made it to the exit, <CHARNAME>. Some... some sacrificed themselves to enable others to flee - without obvious reason.~
@692  = ~They decided to give their life for others.~
@693  = ~That's how a society works that builds itself on community, Solaufein. Sometimes, stronger might sacrifice themselves for the weaker to protect them.~
@694  = ~One or the other probably simply found himself in this role.~
@695  = ~What are you getting at?~
@696  = ~Perhaps. But not all of them. I could listen to some of their talking.~
@697  = ~That's what I didn't get.~
@698  = ~Countless drow sacrifice themselves, in every single fight, but they do it because they know that they have no choice but to praise the spider goddess with their deaths... Because death would await them otherwise anyhow, but a painful, honorless one.~
@699  = ~Nothing of this holds for the slaves that stayed back, fighting, so the others could save themselves.~
@700  = ~Maybe they also did it in their god's honor, we don't know.~
@701  = ~Maybe it was a decision out of mere reasoning. If they wouldn't have faught, all could have died.~
@702  = ~Maybe.~
@703  = ~The slaves were very lucky you were there and gave them the opportunity.~
@704  = ~If my siblings could hear your words, they would take it as an opportunity to praise the superiority of our race. In the believes of the drow, a society that lets the strong die and preserves the weak must inevitably become weak and perish.~
@705  = ~The drow would also become extinct if they would not protect their children.~
@706  = ~This only makes sense if the weak would be always weak and the strong always strong. But it's usually not like that. Neither for long periods of time, nor in relation to different areas of daily life.~
@707  = ~You mean, everyone should contribute most where he or she is best? This is a nice idea, but even here on the surface probably fails due to the vanity of some people.~
@708  = ~But the motivation behind it is quite different. And so is the way it is done.~
@709  = ~Sending the slaves to freedom was a dangerous decision for you. It could have caused your disguise to be blown.~
@710  = ~It was worth the risk.~
@711  = ~Be kind to people on the way up because you never know who you'll meet on the way down, Solaufein.~
@712  = ~It didn't seem so risky to me.~
@713  = ~If that would have happened, so be it. I was ready to fight the moment I entered the city.~
@714  = ~Only you can talk like this. I know you well enough to believe you that you would not have shied away from such a fight.~
@715  = ~You mean... This saying is oddly wise. Yes, I do believe I understand the meaning. You also call it "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours", don't you?~
@716  = ~I am familiar with the concept of mutual help and I am well aware that I have already benefited from it more than average.~
@717  = ~Also, I do see it as a superior concept for a society - but only, if the majority plays by its rules without giving in to behavior dominated by self-interest. Or refuses them for other reasons, like... anxiety.~
@718  = ~I... I did not help those slaves although I would have had the strength to do so. I did not feel responsible for them... and I was in hiding by that time myself and did not want to risk my cover.~
@719  = ~Believe me, this gave me a lot to think about.~
@720  = ~<CHARNAME>, you have changed me. Do you still recognize the drow you met in Ust Natha? I opened up to you. I... trust you, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@721  = ~It is a strange sensation... And I am constantly pondering whether it is appropriate to feel this way. Whether I shouldn't doubt more. Whether I am careless, reckless even. Why do I have these thoughts? Will it always be like this?~
@722  = ~Friendship grows, and it perishes. It is dependent on what we do whether a friendship will last.~
@723  = ~More for some, less for others. You are especially wary due to your past.~
@724  = ~Even friends could betray each other. It is appropriate to reassess relationships from time to time.~
@725  = ~Hm. If you think about it that much, then you do not really trust me yet.~
@726  = ~I guess you can't expect anything else from a drow.~
@727  = ~Oh yes, I do, <CHARNAME>. I might ponder whether it is wise to do so, but I do turn my unprotected back to you. What else would this be than trust? But it seems like every day it has to be... reevaluated.~
/* same as @723 */
@728  = ~More for some, less for others. You are especially wary due to your past.~
@729  = ~Yes, considering how careless I behave in your presence I should kill you just to be sure. At least that would be the drow way in cases like this.~
@730  = ~I am not planning on betraying you. Nor am I reevaluating our friendship. I'm only observing that trust is... complicated, because it includes a loss in control which could be fatal. At least that is what I learned and lived for several centuries.~
@731  = ~I slowly have to get used to the new situation where trust equals a different kind of strength. The strength of those who support each other out of their free will. How I envied you surfacers for this! And I still do, because to my mind it's a great effort.~
@732  = ~And yet it is a... pleasant sensation. I feel alive, as much alive as I haven't for a long time. Who would have thought that such a youngling as you could awaken such feelings inside of me!~
@733  = ~I told you I couldn't get my surfacer armor before rejoining you...~ [c#ablank]
@734  = ~The whole truth is that I couldn't get to it any more due to too many enemies in the vicinity. I... I didn't dare to get it, fearing I might get detected. And you were approaching the exit.~
@735  = ~I didn't dare to! Just because some lousy drow gathered near the crevice it was hidden in.~
@736  = ~You were already quite unsettled because of your decision to go to the surface.~
@737  = ~You emerged from the drider chamber only moments before. It's not a shame to avoid a fight then.~
@738  = ~You didn't want to risk your plan to search for followers of Eilistraee under my protection.~
@739  = ~That was wise. You were under time pressure.~
@740  = ~I'm not interested in this topic, Solaufein.~
@741  = ~All the more important would then have been good armor!~
@742  = ~Even if I knowingly placed myself in unknown danger, and without proper armor?~
@743  = ~My nervousness about your reaching the exit may be understandable, but it was no reason to knowingly enter the unknown dangers of the surface without proper equipment!~
@744  = ~But somehow I preferred to join you badly equipped in time, than risking being well equipped but not meeting you again. I trusted in my fighting prowess, naive like I was. And found myself weakened and blinded in the rising sun and seriously doubted my sanity.~
@745  = ~You... you have no idea how much I was impressed by you taking me on regardless and gearing me up with proper weapons and armor! It was the third act or generosity you bestowed upon me, only this time it was me who put himself into your hands... The foundation for my friendship was laid there, <CHARNAME>, even if I didn't realize it back then.~
@746  = ~Still, my anxiety, hiding between the rocks, not daring to fight for my belongings is a very unpleasant memory for me. I still don't know exactly what was holding me back. I should have stayed and faught for a better armor! It is only now that I dare to tell you this. Never I would have admitted this before. I'd rather claim that the armor got stolen!~
@747  = ~Hmph. That is your right, and yet I feel strangely affronted: That you don't even want to hear my thoughts, which I only am ready to give you after so long and extensive consideration.~
@748  = ~Well, live is full of surprises.~
@749  = ~<CHARNAME>, are you... content with my performance? It is unfamiliar for me to ask this so directly, but I want to make sure.~ [c#ablank]
@750  = ~Yes, very.~
@751  = ~What do you mean with 'content'?~
@752  = ~Why is it uncommon for drow? Do you not ask this directly due to fear of reprisals?~
@753  = ~No, not really.~
@754  = ~Thank you. And yet I need to ask...~
@755  = ~(sigh) Sometimes I wished you were drow. You could take any anger out on me, and I would know instantly that there would be a problem. Like it is now, I have no other choice but to ask directly.~
@756  = ~Is our friendship endangered?~
@757  = ~No. You are and will be my friend.~
@758  = ~What? No, don't be silly.~
@759  = ~To be honest, it's over since a while now. I can't believe I called a drow my friend.~
@760  = ~Reprisals? More than one male was killed cruelly for even *less* than a direct question. So I enjoy, even relish being able to ask you directly.~
@761  = ~I thank you for these words.~
@762  = ~I always thought life in the Underdark was difficult. The right behavior to avoid anger. Never to let on, never to say something wrong... I realize now that it is not completely different here.~
@763  = ~It is worse, even, because here I completely lack experience. Could well be I aroused your anger without even noticing, and I am afraid of this because of the consequences I fear if this would ever happen. It scares me more than anything I ever had to endure in Ust Natha.~
@764  = ~Not because of any physical repercussions I might have to expect. No, what I fear is to hurt you - mentally, and to lose your friendship. But as unusual and exhausting as I find it, I know that it is worth the effort!~
@765  = ~Let us travel on, my friend. Our tasks await.~
@766  = ~I finally got what Drizzt Do'Urden meant when he spoke to me.~ [c#ablank]
@767  = ~You did?~
@768  = ~What do you mean?~
@769  = ~With regard to friendship or with regard to the sun?~
@770  = ~Took you long enough!~
@771  = ~With regard to friendship.~
@772  = ~Friendship goes both ways, doesn't it? Even when I already had yours, I was blind to it. It took me until I was ready to give you mine before I could be your friend.~
@773  = ~Drizzt's statement with regard to the sun will always be a mystery to me, although I can think of many ways to interpret it.~
@774  = ~But enough philosophy! We have to prevent the rising of a dead god.~
@775  = ~You think? I think I was quite quick about it, comparing the timespan it took me with my total age.~
@776  = ~I am referring to his explanations concerning what friendship means.~
@777  = ~Let us move on!~
@778  = ~Certainly. I... should have noticed. I won't pester you with my thoughts any longer.~
@779  = ~I am a fool, thinking I should share my thoughts with you. Maybe it is better this comes to an end now.~

/* scenery_dialogues_soa.d */
@780  = ~The elves aren't aware how lucky they are. Now with House Despana fallen, there will be struggles to fill the power void it created. Many fighters will be called back into the city.~
@781  = ~In addition, you created quite some loss in the drows' ranks when fighting your way to the surface. The elves shouldn't have been so suspicious towards you. You served them well while being down there.~
@782  = ~You may be right.~
@783  = ~I didn't do it for them.~
@784  = ~The elves only do their duty.~
@785  = ~Still, they should be prepared for drow attacks. Now with the silver dragon gone, my kin will become boisterous.~
@786  = ~Now I am were the megalomaniac House Despana was preparing to invade: the secret eleven city. Only I am here to protect it.~
@787  = ~That's right.~
@788  = ~Yes, and I hope for your sake that you will do so.~
@789  = ~Well, considering good Elhan has unleashed his magic on me, I have no other choice.~
@790  = ~Do not doubt my loyalty to your cause.~
@791  = ~The thought alone of how angry Lolth's Handmaidens would be if they could see me here gives me so much childish joy that it is worth helping the elves.~
@792  = ~But not only this, but also the words of my Lady with the Silver Hair let me see it as good to turn away the evil from this city of the surface elves.~
@793  = ~So we did meet the legendary Drizzt Do'Urden. Nobody talks about him, and yet every drow child knows his name.~
@794  = ~For the meeting? I didn't arrange it.~
@795  = ~What for?~
@796  = ~Indeed. Let us move on.~
@797  = ~I thank you for not stepping in as he reprimanded my like a youngling. I guess he was right. Neither my age nor my experience is of any value here.~
@798  = ~Well, your fighting prowess and magic is worth something, I would say.~
@799  = ~Don't take it too much to heart, Solaufein.~
@800  = ~I would like to add something to his words.~
@801  = ~Of course. But you now what I mean.~
@802  = ~Ah?~
@803  = ~Friendship also means that it is not important in which language the other one is talking to you, you know? Politeness means that you let others address you in a language you do not like to hear. And trust means that the other one tolerates it if you want to talk in a language <PRO_HESHE> doesn't understand. That's what I wanted to tell you.~
@804  = ~He was right about what he said to you. You still have a lot to learn.~
@805  = ~Well, I am sure you will succeed in finding what you are searching for.~
@806  = ~But yes, that is exactly what I am doing, and I think it is the right thing to do with his words, <CHARNAME>.~
@807  = ~That's all there is to it, I suppose.~
@808  = ~I... thank you. Yes, I see what you mean. It is the other one's perspective, isn't it? I wonder why he didn't tell me this, as well. Maybe because I have to understand the one he told me first?~
@809  = ~Indeed I still have a long way to go: In my defiance to be rebuked by him, I forgot to thank him for his advice.~
@810  = ~His words gave me enough to ponder, <CHARNAME>. I therefore see your promise fulfilled to bring me together with like-minded people. Let us continue with chasing your foes.~
@811  = ~Such peace...~
@812  = ~Not so long ago my only thought in this temple would have been to plunder it.~
@813  = ~Now I stand here in this quiet twilight and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere.~
@814  = ~It's dawn. In my former life it meant discovery, betrayal and death. A drow who did not manage to return from a pillage at the surface before the break of dawn was as good as dead.~
@815  = ~Not only does the light give advantage to the surfacers, the sun itself is enemy to the drow with its overly bright, searing light.~
@816  = ~Now I am here and can have a close look at the play of lights. Only a moment ago it was gentle... and now the sun is blinding even more because it is so low.~
@817  = ~(snort!) Let us move on and get over with the next bright and blinding day.~
@818  = ~(Solaufein makes a suppressed sound.) That sun!...~
@819  = ~(snort!) Now I know how a Beholder's victim must feel, weaker with every glare... I am supposed to get used to that?~
@820  = ~Even for us the direct sunlight is too bright for our eyes. I can't even imagine how bad it must be for you!~
@821  = ~You'll have to.~
@822  = ~I surely hope so. I don't have a use for a fighter that I need to guide during battle!~
@823  = ~Of course not. How disparagingly the drow speak about their slaves who are almost blind in the darkness. Now I experience the same thing.~
@824  = ~You show much understanding where I would have expected spite.~
@825  = ~Your words are surprisingly matter-of-factly.~
@826  = ~How disparagingly the drow speak about their slaves who are almost blind in the darkness! Now I'm experiencing the same disability, but not the same reaction.~
@827  = ~(snort!) And there is the sun again, shining directly into my face.~
@828  = ~How much your behavior changed, Solaufein. No longer are you avoiding the direct sunlight.~
@829  = ~You can sunbathe another time, Solaufein, we have a lot to do.~
@830  = ~I try to bear the sun, <CHARNAME>. One day I will like to feel him on my skin, at least I hope so. I realized that blinded by the sun I can rely on my other senses just as much as in the darkness of the Underdark. It was the unusual, strange-sounding noises, and other sensations that confused me so much.~
@831  = ~And above all, drow feel uncomfortable in the sun, as it mercilessly exposes us to our enemies. I still fight against this feeling of absolute exposure when his beams hit me. But I'll get over it. I have no choice.~
@832  = ~Hmph. Your sense of humor is overwhelming!~
@833  = ~(Solaufein shakes off some of the rain.) Hmph. I never thought it would ever seem colder than in the depths of the Underdark, but here, soaked and in the wind, I start shaking like a naked toddler. The only advantage of this wheather is the blocked sunlight!~
@834  = ~I feel a strange longing for the warming rays of the sun. I do fear, however, that I won't remember it when he really comes out again.~
@835  = ~The moon!...~
@836  = ~Forgive me. I have never before had the opportunity to look at the sign of my revered goddess in peace.~
@837  = ~But you did see the moon before?~
@838  = ~It's alright. You already said how much you want to see the moon. Now you have all the time you want.~
@839  = ~Indeed! As a true follower of Eilistraee you could take off your clothes and dance naked through the moon light.~
@840  = ~You still don't have it. We have things to do!~
@841  = ~The last time I could have looked at the moon I wasn't even half as old as today - an over-ambitious drow fighter, my head full of the Spider Queen's dogmas. The light of the full moon would only have blinded and betrayed me.~
@842  = ~But I didn't mean to seem idle... I will look up from time to time as we move forward. I enjoy the gentle light compared to the sun, which I can now admire without restriction.~
@843  = ~That is alright. I didn't mean to seem idle. I will probably find more opportunities to admire the glowing disk in the sky.~
@844  = ~Not really. The full moon is much too bright for the drow to feel comfortable in its light. Not that it would dazzle us, but the moonlight permeates the darkness and makes it difficult to hide in the shadows.~
@845  = ~(snort!)~

/* #59142 for male drow/Solaufein */
@857  = ~And he must agree to a geas. That is the only way.~

/* #59144 for male drow/Solaufein */
@859  = ~With the casting of this spell, all my doubt is removed. Solaufein, you are bound to the task, and I fear no treachery. Let death be the threat if I am wrong.~
@860  = ~I swore loyalty to <CHARNAME>. Apply that geas to me then, if you think it necessary.~
@861  = ~I really hope that you're practicing sarcasm with that remark, <CHARNAME>.~
@862  = ~This should suffice... So go, and bring the Lanthorpe back to us. But I would have preferred it if you had not allied yourself with drow, <CHARNAME>!~
@863  = ~So let's move on to the male drow who is accompanying you... If my mages could not read your intentions so well, I would not believe that you are not working with the drow.~
@864  = ~Solaufein, you too are now bound to the task, and I fear no treason.~
@865  = ~No, I cannot support that, <CHARNAME>. This drow represents what I want to achieve!~
@866  = ~A drow fighting by my side! That hasn't happened in a long time.~
@867  = ~Ah. So you attacked because of the reputation of my people? Then why is there a drow in your group? I do not see you attacking *him*.~
@868  = ~Solaufein is an outcast, and he has proven that he can be trusted.~
@869  = ~I don't trust him more than you. He is with me because I have a use for him.~
@870  = ~Solaufein is unique among the drow, and my trust in him is absolute.~
@871  = ~So he is drow, but you do not try to kill him. Then what did I do wrong? I abandoned my people... You will find that I am very different, even from your drow friend.~
@872  = ~Interesting. Maybe you're not the same <PRO_RACE> I met. A lot can change in a relatively short period of time... I know that well.~
@873  = ~Wait!~
@874  = ~You are Drizzt Do'Urden from Menzoberranzan? A follower of Eilistraee! I am in search for you... for drow like you.~
@875  = ~Hm, good to hear. But I see you travelling with this <PRO_RACE>. Are you sure you picked the right leader for this task?~
@876  = ~I do not know what happened between you. <CHARNAME> was generous towards me.~
@877  = ~That's what I like to hear. Do not despair. You're going to lose a lot of your abilities up here. But you will find a freedom you could not have imagined.~
@878  = ~But I don't want to raise any false hopes. You are the enemy of the surfacers, and the majority will always remain hostile to you and hunt you down no matter what you do. Remember this, and seek out the few who are well-disposed towards you.~

@881  = ~My ears have not heard sounds of this language for a long time. Why do you ask me? Why don't you ask your companion?~
@882  = ~Isn't it obvious? We have more in common. You can explain it to me in a way that I can better understand.~
@883  = ~You have great confidence in me. How can I explain something in a few sentences that you have to experience yourself for a long time to understand it? But I don't want to be rude and try.~
@884  = ~But first ask the question so that your companion can understand it.~
@885  = ~I... I asked how to recognize friendship.~
@886  = ~Friendship is based on trust. As long as you do not trust the other, you do not call him your friend.~
@887  = ~But friendship also means that you do not need to speak in a language the other person does not understand, because you can tell a friend everything.~
@888  = ~To make friends, you must be polite. And politeness, my friend, means that you do not address a stranger in a language he has tried to forget for decades.~
@889  = ~I...~
@890  = ~Forgive me.~
@891  = ~Well, I think I understand why you chose this language for your question. You have left the cruel world down there behind you, but I can see that you are aware that this one can be at least as cruel. You are nervous, and you feel fear. Fear that your inexperience will be interpreted as weakness.~
@892  = ~But friendship also means that the other person does not take advantage of your weaknesses and stands by your side, whether in battle or in answering questions.~
@893  = ~Like I said, you have a long way to go to get there. You have shown great courage in leaving the underworld and the cruel world of the drow. I respect that.~
@894  = ~(snort!) Courage? If you want to call it that. I *flew* from there, betrayed and defenceless.~
@895  = ~Yes, courage. Because only those who tame their fear are brave. And that's why I have good hopes that you'll be able to make friends. Never forget: the sun is not your enemy.~
@896  = ~But now, my friends, we have to move on.~
@897  = ~In case I complained about people's hostile *gazes*, I herewith take it back. Good man, I impose no threat to you. I came to the surface in search of those who are not evil.~

@902  = ~This is my fight, Solaufein. You do not have to come with me.~
@903  = ~You experienced how dangerous Irenicus is, Solaufein. You do not have to go any further.~
@904  = ~Are you ready and determined for this fight, Solaufein? I need to be able to count on you when we go down there.~
@905  = ~Nowhere you could take me would be as cruel as where you saved me from, <CHARNAME>. You saved me from being turned into a drider and gave me protection. To support you in your fight for your soul is the right thing to do.~
@906  = ~(snort!) The statement that nowhere could be as bad as where you freed me from I must take back in view of our current whereabouts, <CHARNAME>.~

@918  = ~Why do you ask?~
@919  = ~You're not interested in questioning me about the dogmas of my god, are you?~
@920  = ~Indeed. I watch with interest the inner struggles you fight every day to fulfill the dogmas of your god.~
@921  = ~I'd have to have a drow watching me? What makes you an expert of my 'inner struggles'?!~
@922  = ~Nothing, if we refer to you personally. But I do recognize very well the attitude of someone who has inner struggles that he absolutely does not want to show, Sir Anomen. For this I am definitely someone you could call an 'expert' due to where I come from.~
@923  = ~Strong warrior from Rashemen, I better not tell you what I thought when I first saw your Boo.~

@927  = ~No... Minsc, it was in Ust Natha. I didn't identify your hamster as a... companion.~
@928  = ~No? What else would he be?~
@929  = ~Well... the reason one would take animals when on travel. As I said, do not let us dwell on the matter.~
@930  = ~Jaheira, you might not be surprised if I tell you that I find it difficult to name most of the plants we encounter.~
@931  = ~Not at all.~
@932  = ~But it might surprise you that it is mostly because I see them firstly during the light of the day, not in the dim light of the night.~
@933  = ~That, indeed, is a reason I didn't expect.~
@934  = ~Solaufein, how much do you know about the surface world's flora?~
@935  = ~Not as much as I usually pretend to, Jaheira. But enough as to know that 'flora' means plants.~
@936  = ~Ahem. Yes, indeed. Well, if you have any questions concerning the plants we enconter, especially the trees bearing fruits, eadible roots, and herbs, then do not hesitate to profit from my knowledge.~
@937  = ~You would teach me? I am surprised and humbled, Jaheira. I thank you in advance for your offer.~
@938  = ~It's not charity, Solaufein. <CHARNAME> decided we travel together, so I would prefer not to be incidentally poisoned at our next meal.~
@939  = ~I see. I will try not to poison you incidentally, then.~
@940  = ~That sounded... Never mind.~
@941  = ~You seem to stare at me at times, Solaufein. Is something wrong?~
@942  = ~Well... you have a rather unusual hairdo, Mazzy.~
@943  = ~Nonsense. I'm pretty sure that's not the reason for your gazes.~
@944  = ~Mazzy, my staring was what is commonly known as 'rude'. Please forgive me.~
@945  = ~I don't think you'd see anything you haven't seen before. It only makes me latently nervous to be watched by a drow, even if he is supposedly fighting on my side.~
@946  = ~Mazzy, I had indeed been watching you.~
@947  = ~I know.~
@948  = ~This calmness! This self-assurance! Mazzy, you scare me more than good Imrae during one of her fits.~
@949  = ~Not seriously.~
@950  = ~Well, she definitely caused me more pain, but in a way, yes. I have watched you because I am impressed by your fighting prowess, along with the determination with which you wield your weapon.~
@951  = ~But only because you wouldn't expect it from such a small person like me. (sigh) So the same old story.~
@952  = ~Jan, You're a droll fellow.~
@953  = ~Oh, such an introduction is usually not followed by something good.~
@954  = ~Your way, your stories, the fantasy that goes with them...~
@955  = ~Fantasy? It all happened for real and is nothing but the truth!~
@956  = ~That is exactly what I mean. I never met someone like you in the Underdark. Among the drow noone would expect it anyway, but neither I encountered someone like you among the other races. If there were any, they did not show themselves, obviously.~
@957  = ~I know, everything in honour of the Spider Queen and all the fun for the Handmaidens of Lolth.~
@958  = ~Funnily verbalized, but very true.~
@959  = ~So, the elf with the dark skin wondered why Minsc carries a hamster with him?~
@960  = ~Well... To be honest, I wondered in Ust Natha why you don't have more than one.~
@961  = ~More? Is the dark elf saying that he thinks hamsters on a warrior a normal sight?~
@962  = ~As I said... If, then more than one.~
@963  = ~Is this true? Boo would like to know for what the warriors the dark elf is referring to would take many hamsters with them?~
@964  = ~The same reason you would take living animals along besides weapons, munition, water, and other kind of equipment... Strong warrior from Rashemen, I don't think you want to know.~
@965  = ~Sarevok, I have never seen a person in pursuit of their goals as determined as you are.~
@966  = ~Determined... and successful!~
@967  = ~Successful? You mean because I am the most powerful Bhaalchild and the world is in terror of my wrath as I had originally planned?~
@968  = ~Life would be dreary if goals would not change in the course of it, Sarevok. The truly successful recognizes the opportunities that arise under the given circumstances and uses them!~
@969  = ~Oh, I think I stepped on a spider... Did you hear that crackle?~
@970  = ~It is said that every call of a tortured spider is heard and atoned for by your goddess of spiders, Solaufein. Is it true?~
@971  = ~That is not 'my' goddess.~
@972  = ~I'm sure she has a different opinion on that. Do you not count on her vengeance for your defection?~
@973  = ~You are not scaring me, Korgan.~
@974  = ~It wasn't my intention to scare you. I'm only curious.~
@975  = ~I came to the surface in the search for a less brutal society... And yet you lost your wings due to the cruelty of humans, Arie. I don't know if I should be disappointed that I did not leave senseless evilness behind by leaving the Underdark...~
@976  = ~Or whether I should be relieved that at least this cruelty was not committed by drow.~
@977  = ~There... there is evil in every people, Solaufein.~
@978  = ~That is probably true, but there are varieties in intensity. If it had been drow, you would not be alive any more.~
@979  = ~I... I'm not sure that's a comfort, Solaufein.~
@980  = ~It wasn't meant as one.~
@981  = ~Although there is more truth in your words than you may realize. I... I know very well that I had great luck in my misfortune to be saved and taken in by Quaile.~
@982  = ~Mazzy, can you blame me for noticing your size? When I saw you the first time, you reminded me of a surface snirflebi.~
@983  = ~I guess your Snirflebi weren't so brave?~
@984  = ~Oh, they were brave, the little ones. But not as effective.~
@985  = ~A Snirflebi village with warriors of your combat strength, and the drow in the neighborhood would have lost sooner or later, Mazzy.~
@986  = ~Haha! I like that idea.~
@987  = ~Valygar, I understand you have experience in living a life of secrecy?~
@988  = ~Ha! If you want to phrase it like that, then yes. But it wasn't by choice, it was just the only way. All I wanted was to have safety and live in peace.~
@989  = ~A goal shared by many... and I can well understand why.~
@990  = ~Keldorn, you are constantly looking into my direction. I can see that you are unsure what to make of me.~
@991  = ~Indeed. Your appearance repulses me as it reminds me of the wickedness and corruption of the society to which you belonged and which has shaped you for centuries. It's hard not to hold that against you.~
@992  = ~The normal reaction to the signs of my origin. I do not blame you.~
@993  = ~I left all that behind when leaving the Underdark, Paladin. At least I am trying to.~
@994  = ~Well, someone who has left behind everything he once had and called home, who has broken off all contact and connection to his roots fills me with at least as much concern. Such a person has nothing to lose, no more inhibitions, nothing to hold him back.~
@995  = ~A wise notion.~
@996  = ~Cernd, what do you feel if you think about the Underdark? Is it nature to you like here, above? Or is it an abomination to what you believe in?~
@997  = ~Nature is the blooming, the breathing variety of live in its multiple forms. I do not see this in the Underdark, drow.~
@998  = ~Oh, but there is a lot of life in the Underdark, sometimes at places you wouldn't expect. It's so much more than drow and spiders. If you only think about the vast amount of fluorescent fungi...~
@999  = ~It might be nature, Solaufein, but it is tainted. That is my belief.~
@1000 = ~Edwin, let me get this straight. You sought magic to give you unimaginable power and the result was a gender change to female?~
@1001 = ~By the...! (Even this idiot can't keep his mouth shut about this.) I think everyone *has* noticed by now, but thanks for pointing it out one more time.~
@1002 = ~I was not aware at all that there are spells that are in accodance to the hirarchical structure of the drow society. Greatest imaginable power equals being a female. Really, no scheming, powerful Handmaiden of Lolth could have thought of it better.~
@1003 = ~The 'hirarchical structure of the drow society' was about the last I was thinking of at that moment, drow!~
@1004 = ~Of course. It just occurred to me.~
@1005 = ~Edwin, I don't understand your motives. Why are you still at <CHARNAME>'s side?~
@1006 = ~Joint adventures! Campfire romanticism! Deep, friendly connection!~
@1007 = ~A man like you should be capable of friendship?~
@1008 = ~(Alright, now he's getting cocky.) Now you are getting cocky. Look who's talking, hm? Did you hear the rattling and clinking of your glass house when you threw the stone?~
@1009 = ~You... are right. I am indeed not the right person to doubt it.~
@1010 = ~Ha! I wasn't finished with my list. Helping to influence fate! To secure the biggest piece of the cake! Laugh in the face of the other Bhaalchildren! Become the most powerful mage in all of Faern!~
@1011 = ~Well, this sounds more like you.~
@1012 = ~The reasons can be manifold! Take your pick!~
@1013 = ~I do see you, female.~
@1014 = ~Ah, so the male can talk. I was wondering if I should demand your respect.~
@1015 = ~Demand respect... oh yes. Aren't we all here to leave the drow society behind?~
@1016 = ~That doesn't mean I have to take insolence from you.~
@1017 = ~Haer'Dalis, I apologize, but I have to say it...~
@1018 = ~So, you are a tiefling.~
@1019 = ~Well spotted! And I have to say, I do believe you are a drow.~
@1020 = ~Indeed!~
@1021 = ~And I did see this, although you drow look one alike the other, for the eye untrained to the Underdark! This sparrow is a most resourceful one, is he not?...~
@1022 = ~Solaufein, I do have the impression that you are looking at me, is it not so, my black Underdark wolf?~
@1023 = ~Solaufein, did you not encounter other tieflings in your city of black Underdark wolves?~
@1024 = ~I admit I did, Haer'Dalis. I could not stop myself from wondering what my Matron Mother would have thought of you, would you and your actor's group appear at her doorstep.~
@1025 = ~Does the Underdark wolf doubt we could entertain a Matron Mother?~
@1026 = ~Absolutely not. I am just not sure the entertainment the Matron Mother would make you do would have anything to do with you acting a theatractical play, Haer'Dalis.~
@1027 = ~I did, but only a few. Seldom there are visits from the outer planes to the realms of the drow, and if there are, the drow see to it stopping very quickly.~
@1028 = ~So, no story worth telling? No encounter that left an impression on you so great you would like to share it with the rest?~
@1029 = ~Whatever my experiences with tieflings' encounters in the past, Haer'Dalis, believe me if I say it's not a story you would like to act in a theatrical play for amusement.~
@1030 = ~Imoen, I didn't want to imply anything about your and <CHARNAME>'s connection when I spoke recently. My choice of words was clumsy. I was referring to the arbitrary associations of Bhaalchildren, that form currently out of reasons of convenience.~
@1031 = ~I'm aware of that, Solaufein.~
@1032 = ~Although the choice of words was *really* inappropriate, considering that <CHARNAME> and I were temporarily... well, separated.~
@1033 = ~Stop wringking your forehead in self-criticism! Your remark wasn't *that* bad. I won't take blame for your wrinkles!~
@1034 = ~Mazzy, you seem amazingly unexcited about all the things that are happening to us around <CHARNAME>.~
@1035 = ~To become hectic now would be counterproductive. I can't afford a reduction in my fighting capacity.~
@1036 = ~Wise words. It's a principle everyone should have understood - in principle.~
@1037 = ~You don't seem too nervous either, Solaufein.~
@1038 = ~Well, there wouldn't be any use to it, would there?~
@1039 = ~True.~
@1040 = ~Tell me, Anomen. Why Helm?~
@1041 = ~Why did you choose the god of duty, vigilance and protection when a god with... impulsive aggressiveness would suit you so much better?~
@1042 = ~'Suit me better'?! How should I react to such insolence?~
@1043 = ~That's what I meant. Your initial reaction is impulsive. Ah, yes, and now I see how your mind intervenes and you remember the dogmas of your god. But it is a perpetual struggle for you not to give in to the first impulses, isn't it?~
@1044 = ~Where is this stupid talk going? Are you accusing me of betraying my god?!~
@1045 = ~What? No, didn't you listen to what I said?~
@1046 = ~Solaufein, can you not understand that I turn to a god who demands that I act deliberately, attentively and wisely?~
@1047 = ~What is wrong with living your life according to the dogmas of your god, even if it requires effort and self-control, Solaufein? There is nothing wrong with it, as long as the dogmas embody what you strive for in your life!~
@1048 = ~On the contrary. And yet your life would be plagued by far less self-doubt if you would not.~
@1049 = ~This argument is idle, and unproven. Just as well I could confront you with turning away from the most powerful goddess of the drow, although this means so many complications for you. And yet you did it because you find yourself in Eilistraee's believes.~
@1050 = ~True, and well spoken.~
@1051 = ~So you think a sense of duty is desirable?~
@1052 = ~Absolutely!~
@1053 = ~Absolutely? Well, I think it's desirable, but only if it doesn't lead to meaningless actions.~
@1054 = ~Meaningless? How could doing your duty be meaningless, Solaufein? Don't question the duty of a knight to sacrifice his own well-being for others! It is never pointless to fight for others.~
@1055 = ~I wasn't referring to that. No, I meant the knight who perseveres at his post without need - out of a sense of duty. He achieves nothing, he accomplishes nothing, he exhausts his powers for nothing. Then it's meaningless.~
@1056 = ~But then your knight has neglected his duty to watch his own strength, to be prepared, to know where he should be!~
@1057 = ~If I didn't know better, I would accuse you of having a simple view of things.~
@1058 = ~Solaufein, I am surprised of your little magic abilities.~
@1059 = ~Solaufein, calling my reason at <CHARNAME>'s side 'adventuring' is not completely fair.~
@1060 = ~Well, <PRO_HESHE> did a great deal for me by fighting for me, so I feel kind of... obliged. But then... I just couldn't stay there any longer. It didn't feel like it is still my place.~
@1061 = ~Solaufein, can you not understand the urge to leave the limiting bounds of a home full of restrictions, a society full of rules and expectations concerning your appearance?~
@1062 = ~Imagining my aunt's face when we will meet again, after all *this*!...~
@1063 = ~...You did notice the part where I complainted about them greatly diminished since I left the Underdark?~
@1064 = ~I am talking about your ability to throw spells. You don't seem to be able to learn any.~
@1065 = ~Nalia, I am not a mage. I am a fighter.~
@1066 = ~But the drow are a magic race. They are supposed to have magic abilities far beyond of any surfacer.~
@1067 = ~We have. I have. Or when did you last see a fighter with the magic I have?~
@1068 = ~But it's not the same!~
@1069 = ~That, I am afraid, is a complaint you'd have to address someplace else.~
@1070 = ~Nalia, you set out to seek help to rescue your keep from a monster invasion.~
@1071 = ~And then you remained at <CHARNAME>'s side for what? Adventuring?~
@1072 = ~Oh, but it is so much more than that. I took it as an opportunity to get out and help making this world a better place.~
@1073 = ~We have that in common, have we not? You are also here because you set out to make your society a better place.~
@1074 = ~With the little difference that I am mainly at <CHARNAME>'s side because I am a refugee, hoping to find likemind drow while at the surface.~
@1075 = ~Well...~
@1076 = ~And from *there* I'll set out and try to bring my people a better society.~
@1077 = ~I can relate to the sentiment... But it would be your home still, if you wish so.~
@1078 = ~Nalia, I fled from torture, brutality and death. The restrictions and rules you speak of seem of rather little impact in comparison.~
@1079 = ~That is because you are not trained to see the different shades of a surface world's life, Solaufein. I assure you my reasons to leave my home are well justified.~
@1080 = ~I did not say I doubt it.~
@1081 = ~You mean all the blood on our hands? Or the sand of these far away lands in our hair?~
@1082 = ~I *meant* the godly intervenience! The travelling at the side of the chosen one, the shaping of destiny!~
@1083 = ~Are we doing this?~
@1084 = ~Are we not?~
@1085 = ~So, what do you think she would say, your aunt?~
@1086 = ~(sigh) She would probably scold me for not wiping my boots appropriately upon entering.~
@1087 = ~Jaheira, what plant is this? It resembles a herb I saw in a book...~
@1088 = ~It's a herb. Three leaves cooked together with your soup gives a well liked flavour.~
@1089 = ~Three leaves of this? In whole, or in tiny pieces?~
@1090 = ~In whole, and after the cooking, you take them out. They are not meant to be eaten.~
@1091 = ~So their spice is welcome but they themselves are not. I see. Thank you, druid.~
@1092 = ~Jan, there's another reason why there are none like you in the Underdark.~
@1093 = ~Because they were fed to the spiders a long time ago?~
@1094 = ~No. Because of no turnips!~
@1095 = ~Wha... That would have been my line!~
@1096 = ~Valygar, did you become a ranger because of hiding in nature, or were you already before?~
@1097 = ~I always felt strongy connected to nature. I do not believe that a person on the run can win wild animals' trust if he didn't felt it before.~
@1098 = ~Everyone turns to what he or she feels most comfortable with if they need to hide I suppose. Others might feel more at ease in the anonymity of a big city. That was never the place for me.~
@1099 = ~Yes, you have to hide where you feel most at ease... or go away completely, far away from the realms of your enemies. That is what I have done...~
@1100 = ~Great warrior from Rashemen.~
@1101 = ~Drow warrior from the Underdark!~
@1102 = ~You are right, addressing someone like this sounds exaggerated.~
@1103 = ~Boo says he likes Minsc being addressed this way. He misses it from Rashemen where it was used more often!~
@1104 = ~Boo was with you back then already? I thought...~
@1105 = ~Boo says, that is not important.~
@1106 = ~As you wish, great warrior from Rashemen!~
@1107 = ~I'll tell you later what I was about to say.~
@1108 = ~Sarevok, goals and possibilities change in life as I already said. Look at me, not two centuries ago I would have smashed in everyone's head who would have dared to defile the Spider Queen's name, and I would have done it with the eagerness of a full believer. Now on the other hand...~
@1109 = ~We both travel on <CHARNAME>'s side.~
@1110 = ~Yes, but I was saved by <CHARNAME> from my imminent fate, or I wouldn't have the chance to be here.~
@1111 = ~And that wouldn't be true for me?~
@1112 = ~Pardon? Well, if it suits you. I think receiving a part of a Bhaal essence was the last needed step to fulfill your plan. You had everything prepared and laid out, you could set the conditions for this deal. <CHARNAME> had no other choice then to restore you.~
@1113 = ~Presented like this it indeed sounds fantastic. But you have forgotten the despair and sense of hopelessness from which the whole thing was born.~
@1114 = ~Imoen, it is remarkable that you and <CHARNAME>, after growing up almost like siblings, now actually share the fate of the bhaal children through the blood of your divine father.~
@1115 = ~(sigh) Tell me about it.~
@1116 = ~Actually, thinking about it it's more that <CHARNAME> is sharing with me, so to say. I feel like the dumb little sister coming late to the party... Doesn't mean I'd like to switch places, though.~
@1117 = ~Imoen, your... heritage starts to show?~
@1118 = ~I have dreams... It reminds me strongly of what <CHARNAME> went through.~
@1119 = ~Let's hope <PRO_HESHE>'ll finish <PRO_HISHER> destiny-shaping before I start turning into the slayer or somesuch.~
@1120 = ~Because you were asking recently, Korgan: Yes, Lolth guards her beloved spiders, and she likes to punish any misdeed performed on them - or she lets punish them, to be precise.~
@1121 = ~Are you trying to scare me now?~
@1122 = ~What? No, I am simply answering the question you posed then.~
@1123 = ~And yes, she most likely sees me as a renegade. But how far a goddess will bother to come after me... I don't think that's very likely. She can trust on my kin to do the job for her.~
@1124 = ~But keep on squashing small spiders on our path. If you collect enough of them under your shoes it might attract her attention.~
@1125 = ~Aerie, it is indeed true that you had to endure a serious stroke of fate. But why are you weakening yourself?~
@1126 = ~What... what do you mean by that? I might not be as physically strong as you, but what gives you the right to call me weak?~
@1127 = ~Avariel, I never said you are weak. You master your profession and you use it reliably to our advantage despite your displayed anxiety which indicates great mental strength. Nobody expects physical strength without the necessary prerequisites.~
@1128 = ~But you are quite weak, and it is largely because of your despondency. You could overcome that if you wanted to.~
@1129 = ~If I wanted to?!~
@1130 = ~Yes. You weaken yourself by trying to hold on to what is irretrievably lost.~
@1131 = ~Th-That's easy for you to say! I have been cruelly mutilated and robbed of my home. You don't seem to understand that this is nothing to be shaken off easily, Solaufein.~
@1132 = ~Minsc, I have to acknowledge a certain capability of yours.~
@1133 = ~Minsc is used to his strength being noted.~
@1134 = ~Well, it's not directly related to that...~
@1135 = ~What I was referring to is your capability to provide for this animal in your backpack despite all the things we do and encounter. I am impressed.~
@1136 = ~The drow warrior is referring to Boo? Minsc would never let Boo come to harm!~
@1137 = ~I know that, and I am impressed that your Boo doesn't get hurt accidentlly, either.~
@1138 = ~Boo can watch out for himself very well as well!~
@1139 = ~Always for the eyes, Minsc, I know.~
@1140 = ~Valygar, we only visit forests seldomly as of late. Do you miss the animals of your forest?~
@1141 = ~It is unfamiliar, indeed. But as a ranger I feel connected to any nature, Solaufein.~
@1142 = ~You are far away now, though, which was never your plan.~
@1143 = ~I am not sure why I would tell you this, but yes, we are far away from my forest. I would prefer being back there, leading a quiet life in my hut in the wild. But I also am quite aware that this is currently no option!~
@1144 = ~There is nothing I could achieve while staying in my forest, Solaufein. I would try soothing the frightened animals, every day, probably cursing destiny. No, there is more I can do for the nature I love and the return of quietness to my forest in these foreign lands by fighting fate at <CHARNAME>'s side.~
@1145 = ~Keldorn, if I would point out now that I did not leave all the indoctrination of my people behind just because it is not that easy to do so - meaning I did not cut all roots, does that make you relax more around me in any way?~
@1146 = ~I beg your pardon? Of course not.~
@1147 = ~Of course not. I just wanted to tease you with your own words.~
@1148 = ~It was worth a try, though.~
@1149 = ~I will continue to watch you closely, Solaufein.~
@1150 = ~You will do that, and I can't blame you.~
@1151 = ~Cernd, do you not see the nature in the realms below the surface? All the animals. You do feel related to animals, do you not?~
@1152 = ~Animals? I do feel related to them, yes. But they are scarce in the Underdark.~
@1153 = ~What? But the whole Underdark is crawling with them! Spiders, night hunters, shriekers, sinisters...~
@1154 = ~These I usually call 'monsters', Solaufein. Not animals.~
@1155 = ~Oh... Er, cavekkans?~
@1156 = ~Your attempt is mute, Solaufein.~
@1157 = ~Solaufein, I cannot imagine you are proposing the Underdark monsters to be animals. Do you really want me to believe that you drow call spiders 'animals'?~
@1158 = ~Cernd, my druid, we do not.~
@1159 = ~So, why did you...~
@1160 = ~We usually call then 'pets', Cernd.~
@1161 = ~The squalidness of the drow shows no end.~
@1162 = ~Sir Anomen, rarely I have seen someone as much in need of guidance as you are...~
@1163 = ~What insolence is this? Another attempt of telling me how insufficient I am?~
@1164 = ~Maybe. But my point is, that you are in need of guidance, and you chose well. Your god, your leader, both chosen wisely to attain your goals.~
@1165 = ~Wisely chosen? I did not 'chose' Helm, as it was he who accepted my prayers to be his priest. I did not chose <CHARNAME>, as <PRO_HESHE> decided to take me as <PRO_HISHER> fighting comrade when I approached <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@1166 = ~Oh, but you did not betray your god, neither did you abandon <CHARNAME>, Sir Anomen, but let <PRO_HIMHER> lead you. You have far greater input to your destiny's shaping than you make yourself believe.~
@1167 = ~T'is a strange time to tell me that I have a say in my destiny, but... No, I do not believe in you complimenting me. I will turn your statement around until I'll find the insult that's hidden in it.~
@1168 = ~You are welcome.~
@1169 = ~Anomen, rarely I have seen someone as much in need of guidance as you are...~
@1170 = ~Maybe. But my point is, that you are in need of guidance, and you chose well. Your god, your leader, both chosen wisely to mirror your personality, to free you from any restraints and show your true colors.~
@1171 = ~Wisely chosen? I did not 'chose' my god, as it was he who accepted me after Helm abandoned me. I did not chose <CHARNAME>, as <PRO_HESHE> decided to take me as <PRO_HIMHER> fighting comrade when I approached <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@1172 = ~Oh, but you let this god take you on, and you did not abandon <CHARNAME>, Anomen, but let <PRO_HIMHER> lead you. You have far greater input to your destiny's shaping than you make yourself believe.~
@1173 = ~Why did you insist on discussing that spell in all detail, Solaufein?~
@1174 = ~Do you suggest I try to sell it to the highest bidder in the Underdark? How sad we just went there and won't return anytime soon. (A little bit of irony... Not that anyone would notice.)~
@1175 = ~Not at all. You would only be laughed at. You know, a male can always demonstrate and prove his worth in the spider pits and fights for the honor of the Spider Queen. A female however, without connections, supporters, and males at her service is already practically dead.~
@1176 = ~Oh, what a *pity*. And I was already hoping for a decent gold source! (I hope my irony is not completely lost on this fool.)~
@1177 = ~Hm, it does give certain possibilities to harm other Houses, though. Maybe you wouldn't be laughed at as much as I thought.~
@1178 = ~(No, I will not going to answer. Enough talking about this!)~
@1179 = ~What is our purpose here, Viconia? Why are you accompanying <CHARNAME>?~
@1180 = ~You honor our origin with your mistrust but I have to disappoint you, Solaufein. I was saved by <CHARNAME> from brainless surfacers who tried to burn me on the stake.~
@1181 = ~Saved? Our <CHARNAME> finds great joy in saving drow in need it seems.~
@1182 = ~But you didn't answer my question. Why are you still here?~
@1183 = ~Where else should I be? Why are you still here?~
@1184 = ~Jaheira, look at this plant. Is it useful?~
@1185 = ~Its leaves are very useful.~
@1186 = ~They are big, and rather soft. What do you use them for?~
@1187 = ~Well... As you noticed, they are soft. You use the leaves, to... Erm...~
@1188 = ~Well, just take some with you next time you leave for the bushes. Ahem.~
@1189 = ~I... see. How very thoughtful. And so much better as to the limited possibilities there are in the Underdark.~
@1190 = ~Solaufein, I did not intend to elaborate on the subject.~
@1191 = ~Jan, although talking in jest, I was completely serious. There is noone like you in the Underdark.~
@1192 = ~Because everyone of us is unique?~
@1193 = ~No, because down there are only few who have the wisdom to understand when they can't change something and the willingness to accept this fact. And because down there is no one who does not confuse love with the desire to possess.~
@1194 = ~Oh, drow, now this is getting a bit too personal for me. I certainly don't want to discuss this with you.~
@1195 = ~Besides, I'm pretty sure you stopped talking about me. 'Wisdom' is an attribute that hasn't been connected to me for at least the last three quarters of my life.~
@1196 = ~Solaufein, your words the other day were droll. Ha! Banned into hell can have its advantages, is this what you were saying?~
@1197 = ~At least if you want to stay alive and have children of Bhaal as siblings, as it seems. As I said: the successful make use of the possibilities they see.~
@1198 = ~And then hopefully have the wisdom to see what they achieved and be satisfied with it.~
@1199 = ~In case that was a hidden warning - believe me, I gained a lot of wisdeom when haunting the shadows of the hells.~
@1200 = ~I didn't imply it would be easy for you to leave the past behind, Avariel. What I meant was your judgement of the current situation. It is dependent on your attitude towards it.~
@1201 = ~Take me as an example. I was taken out of my familiar surroundings and placed in this awful bright sunlight. I am as good as blind and my skin develops blisters even if I stay in the shadows. And yet, I am not unpleased.~
@1202 = ~D-do you seriously compare my situation with yours?~
@1203 = ~You say you are mutilated and robbed of your home. Well, I am deprived of my home as well, because even if I wanted to, I can't go back there. And I feel mutilated, Avariel, because the sun gives me eternal blindness and burnt skin. I feel like standing in a pool of lava with gouged eyes. Admittedly, this would pass if I went back into the darkness. But there is no home for me left, so I will continue to stumble around like a moule, begging <CHARNAME> for wound healing.~
@1204 = ~Of course, the comparison to losing your wings is ridiculous, I know. But can't you imagine that another drow not coming here voluntarily would be so limited that he would despair?~
@1205 = ~A drow should despair? I-I always thought that's impossible in your culture.~
@1206 = ~The way drow do despair. I didn't say he would lose heart. But he *would* come to death more quickly, be it out of cockiness, desperation, or lack of caution due to the believe that he can't positively influence his fate.~
@1207 = ~That is what I meant.~
@1208 = ~The lack of faith in being able to interfere in the cause of one's own fate is something I can understand, Solaufein. The rest was a completely failed attempt at a comparison.~
@1209 = ~Keldorn, I am still very unfamiliar with the laws and customs of the surfacers regarding living together in families, especially the bond between a man and a woman, as fascinating as I find the idea behind it.~
@1210 = ~If I understood correctly, your wife did...~
@1211 = ~Be silent, drow, and stay quiet. You will not talk about my family.~
@1212 = ~May I at least ask...~
@1213 = ~No! No more word.~
@1214 = ~Cernd, but what would you do, had you the power to eliminate the Underdark. Would you let it vanish? Would you turn it inside out, let the blooming, breathing life of the surface, as you called it, take it over?~
@1215 = ~That is a difficult question, drow. I am no god, it is mute to even think about it.~
@1216 = ~But all the disgust you feel. You surely have an opinion as to what would be best for the Underdark, could you change it?~
@1217 = ~I would... I surely would eliminate all the dark places, crawling with evilness, and...~
@1218 = ~(sigh) It is not that easy, it never is. I strive for balance, and balance can only be if there is equal weight on both sides of the scales. Where there is good, there has to evil, where there is light there has to be darkness to even it out. The more light and beauty there is in this world, the more evil and darkness there will be in the shadows of it - and it has to be this way.~
@1219 = ~That was a far more sensible answer than I expected.~
@1220 = ~Does that mean you think the Underdark is good, as it is? Seeing how it takes on the evil and darkness to even out your beautiful surface nature?~
@1221 = ~(sigh)~
@1222 = ~You keep on lamenting, male, although you haven't lived through half of what I did. Not only was I chased away by the drow. Surfacers also betrayed, tortured, and threatened me with death!~
@1223 = ~Are we playing 'who got it worse'? Then let me play my trump card: have you ever been inside a drider cocoon, Viconia?~
@1224 = ~As I said, lamenting! You are whining like a cild, and that is how you were taken by <CHARNAME> to the surface. I had to go the path on my own!~
@1225 = ~Hmph. You are right that due to <CHARNAME>'s protection, my time at the surface so far was rather pleasant compared to yours. I am not denying that.~
@1226 = ~And yet you are too quick to judge me. After all, no one can tell how much you moaned and cursed when you wandered the lands alone!~
@1227 = ~Jaheira, this plant there resembles the one you showed me for the... special purpose, if you recall.~
@1228 = ~Don't touch it! This is not the same that I showed you. This is a plant special to these parts of the Realms. This plant will make your skin prickle and sting!~
@1229 = ~You mean I shouldn't have gotten some when last I went behind the bushes?~
@1230 = ~Did you...?~
@1231 = ~No, because as you said, it made my hands prickle and sting. I am not masochistic enough to try it on other skin parts.~
@1232 = ~I am... relieved to hear it. But again, I did not mean to elaborate on the subject.~
@1233 = ~Jan, am I correct in assuming that you would choose not to accept a divine throne?~
@1234 = ~Whoa? What an idea. I never thought about it...~
@1235 = ~But you are right. I wouldn't take on the heritage with its hell enclave indeed.~
@1236 = ~No turnips!...~
@1237 = ~Heh, yes, you took the words right out of my mouth.~
@1238 = ~But in all seriousness, Jan. As droll as you come across, I have rarely seen anyone who can make decisions so calmly in the heat of the moment.~
@1239 = ~Ah? This reminds me of Aunt Lotty when she found uncle Eugen's slippers in the turnip vat. A very nice story!...~
@1240 = ~I have also never met anyone who makes so many people furious with his abstruse stories, and yet is still alive...~
@1241 = ~But please, tell me your story. Who knows how long we will have time for conversations like this one.~
@1242 = ~Aerie, I know my example recently has been misguided. Not only is my blindness only temporary on contrary to your missing wings. Also the leaving of my 'home' was although partly forced welcomed by me.~
@1243 = ~To ask you to accept your fate as willingly as I accept mine is not appropriate.~
@1244 = ~Still, I... understand what you mean, Solaufein. Even though I ask you to refrain from such comparisons in the future. Otherwise I get the impression that you can't understand what it means for an Avariel to lose her wings.~
@1245 = ~No, I really do not know that, because I never had wings myself. But classifying your mood and pointing it out to you is something I can do.~
@1246 = ~It... it's still not fair to compare mine with yours, you said so yourself.~
@1247 = ~Which comparison used for a rebuke is truly fair... I understand your reluctance.~
@1248 = ~Keldorn, only one question to your family, if I may. Have...~
@1249 = ~Silence! I said you will not talk about this.~
@1250 = ~Not even as an abstract example to help me understand your customs?~
@1251 = ~Not even that. Not a word!~
@1252 = ~Why not?~
@1253 = ~Because... it is about my family. And it hurts.~
@1254 = ~I thank you. I think I did learn something about the customs of the surfacers through your reaction.~
@1255 = ~Viconia, you... have my respect. You are right to describe my situation as comfortable compared to what you had to suffer.~
@1256 = ~Be glad we are travelling with <CHARNAME> as our leader or I would have you kneel before me in the dirt!~
@1257 = ~I said you have my respect, not that I would be begging for some kind of forgiveness. You deserve my respect if you have mastered this time of blindness, heat and dwindling abilities alone.~
@1258 = ~Even though there might be advantages of spending this time alone. Having to ignore all instincts of self-protection in this weakened state for not risking to offend the friendly surfacers has its own strenuousness...~
@1259 = ~Lamenting again! Get out of my sight. My ears ring from your whining!~
@1260 = ~Aerie, I pondered my words from recently and found an inconsistency. You are not weak, especially not in your spirit. On the contrary, with regard to the circumstances you are very courageous indeed.~
@1261 = ~These... these words from you make me quite happy, Solaufein.~
@1262 = ~(snort!) Which doesn't mean that in my opinion you dwell on the past way too much... which I conclude from your constant yammer about it.~
@1263 = ~Really? I... I didn't say anything recently, although I wanted to.~
@1264 = ~Yes. I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Someone... someone was lamenting about the bright sunlight.~
@1265 = ~I... see. Excellent counter, Avariel.~
@1266 = ~Keldorn, I heard you pray not too long ago... You include your family in your prayers.~
@1267 = ~Does this surprise you? I pray for those I love, drow. Is praying for others so strange to you?~
@1268 = ~Well... We prayed for our Matron Mother and the Handmaidens indeed, but not out of our free will but because it was expected.~
@1269 = ~The thought of praying for someone just because one wishes this person well... I never felt it before.~
@1270 = ~You now have the opportunity to have this experience, Solaufein. Finding true friends you love for their own sake.~
@1271 = ~You mean, if there will be anyone left after these chaotic times?~
@1272 = ~There will be many who remain and will be thankful for any help to return to a normal life.~
@1273 = ~And that, Solaufein, was the very last time that I would talk to you about my family.~
@1274 = ~Up to now I felt relatively safe from divine intervention, since I did not offer such a large area of attack. But the more spiders we crush in <CHARNAME>'s wake, the more I wonder if Lolth might be looking at this godchild after all... and at those who travel with him.~
@1275 = ~Getting scared after all?~
@1276 = ~No, I don't think so. But it's always a double-edged sword to mess with gods. My little hope is that Lolth will get a divine headache from all her angry gnashing of teeth.~
@1277 = ~You still believe to be of higher worth than me, don't you?~
@1278 = ~What were you? A drow commander, letting himself being bullied around like a novice.~
@1279 = ~(snort!) As if you didn't know I had no choice. What were you, a daughter of a mighty house, and yet you let yourself be cast out!~
@1280 = ~(Talks threatening in drow.)~
@1281 = ~Oh, sure, Viconia! (Solaufein also talk in drow.)~
@1282 = ~One more word in drow from either of you and you'll find yourself alone at the side of the street!~
@1283 = ~Solaufein, Viconia! Stop fighting immediately!~
@1284 = ~The conversation is pointless, since either of you two can't go back to your people!~
@1285 = ~(You let them talk on.)~
@1286 = ~Ha! Are you listening to yourself when talking?~
@1287 = ~Yes... And I don't like what I am hearing right now.~
@1288 = ~(growls) <CHARNAME>, this female thinks she could intimidate me with her constant stares, and her overbearing manner...~
@1289 = ~Ha, 'overbearing manner'! Just because I don't react to your whining with well-meaning understanding like <CHARNAME>?~
@1290 = ~You think I should actually feel at home in your presence?~
@1291 = ~I do, Viconia. You remind me of Ardulace and Imrae and how all of the cruel drow females were called who made my life unbearable!~
@1292 = ~I... I am no longer like this, Solaufein.~
@1293 = ~(snort!) No, indeed, you are not. And it is better that way, or <CHARNAME> wouldn't bother with you.~
@1294 = ~We had Avariel among the slaves once... It was nice to watch them flutter about. Some of them had their wings clipped because the overseers got tired of catching them...~
@1295 = ~But none of them survived for long. They only lasted a few days... Then they were dead on the ground. They just passed away as the hopelessness in the dark consumed them.~
@1296 = ~Why... why do you always tell me such cruel things?~
@1297 = ~Because that's what I was, Avariel. Cruel. And because it impressed me. Human slaves live for long years in even the most adverse conditions. Avariel wasted away in so little time. I only saw their weakness, Aerie. Proof of the drow's superiority...~
@1298 = ~But you embody what my Lady with the Silver Hair describes as worth protecting. And I have depended on your spells often enough with my life to see the truth in her words and to expose the blindness of my cruel people.~
@1299 = ~Don't let hopelessness get the best of you, Aerie. I... I've seen how quickly you Avariel pass away if you do.~
@1300 = ~Viconia, I've been speaking too harshly. I do not need to see your burnt skin to know that you are different from the dominant drow females I left behind.~
@1301 = ~Don't think I've gone weak, male! I can still beat you with ease.~
@1302 = ~(snort!) The last venom of a tamed viper. The vigour with which you must proclaim this speaks for itself, Viconia. The question is, who is hiding here in <CHARNAME>'s protection?~
@1303 = ~Perhaps you should tell me encouraging things, Solaufein, so that I do not lose hope, if that is your wish. And not always these cruelties...~
@1304 = ~I've been thinking about our last conversation, Solaufein.~
@1305 = ~The mere fact that you suffer from the bad things the drow do and have done shows that you are different.~
@1306 = ~But that you do not want to admit this change to yourself shows just this: That you are pondering it. This shows that you have left the customs of your people behind and changed.~
@1307 = ~It may seem strange to you, but I must first learn that not everyone draws a feeling of superiority from the sight of the suffering of others.~
@1308 = ~Indeed! Is this what you do? To draw satisfaction from the misfortunes of others?~
@1309 = ~No more... at least not in the same way. You must remember that I come from a society where one's failure is another's success. The punishment of the other meant to be spared yourself. The suffering of the other, no matter what caused it, was my secret joy, because it brought me a bit further up.~
@1310 = ~Now I am here, and I see your suffering, but it does not help me. I can take no advantage of it.~
@1311 = ~On the contrary. In fact, your injuries and the resulting limitations are a disadvantage for me as your fighting companion.~
@1312 = ~Because... because I keep on lamenting about it?~
@1313 = ~I see the mischevious sparkle in your eyes, Aerie. You give me a lot of credit if you think I will understand your jesting. You don't seem to be afraid of the drow in front of you. Not so long ago, I would have ripped your wings off without hesitation if circumstances demanded it.~
@1314 = ~It may not have been too long ago, but as you said yourself, it is in the past.~
@1315 = ~You seem to see this more clearly than even I do. Not so long ago, I would have called it naivety and sneered at you for it.~
@1316 = ~Not so long ago you would not have had discussions of this content with me.~
@1317 = ~That's true, but I am and will always be drow. And so it is...~
@1318 = ~I... I wonder which one of us is holding on to his old self right now... drow.~
@1319 = ~You mean I apply double standards?... You may be right.~
@1320 = ~(snort!) Yes, only it will bring me nothing but an earlier death.~
@1321 = ~An... an earlier death than which one? The one <CHARNAME> spared you in Ust Natha? Or the one as a drider?~
@1322 = ~Now you're mixing up different arguments. I talked about being even weaker and an easier target - through the considerations of good and evil, which reduce my power of decision. Even in your world, weakness is not always a strength.~
@1323 = ~But sometimes you have to go through a period of weakness to emerge stronger.~
@1324 = ~If you survive such a period, Aerie. If you survive it.~
@1325 = ~You are no longer in the Underdark, Solaufein. You... you have friends who will help you.~
@1326 = ~Not too long ago, this alone would have been a reason for my end as spider food.~
@1327 = ~But I see what you mean. I thank you for your kind words.~

/* C#SOLAU_ToB_fatesp.D */
@1328 = ~Bring me Solaufein, the drow fighter who I saved from the drider cocoons.~

/* C#SOLAU_ToB.D */
@1329 = ~<CHARNAME>! If it is you who summoned me here, then I can put away my weapons... I assume? What am I for you, in this place?~ [c#ablank]
@1330 = ~Solaufein, my friend! We spent time together on my travels. I need your help again.~
@1331 = ~I know we parted after I rescued you from the drider cocoons, but I do need you now.~
@1332 = ~Then I will accompany you, if you wish.~
@1333 = ~Yes, join me.~
@1334 = ~Not right now. You'll have to wait.~
@1335 = ~I will.~
@1336 = ~Then I'll wait. At least I won't get a sunburn in this place.~
@1337 = ~This spirit is full of the will to live. Rarely I have seen one cling to live as desperate, and effective, as this one.~
@1338 = ~Tell me about Solaufein.~
@1339 = ~Ah, Solaufein. The drow of neutral alignment, tainted in his own world for being too sympathetic, tainted in the surface world for belonging to an evil race. You freed him from a fate he himself calls worse than a painful death...~
@1340 = ~Now he is travelling with the chosen one, shaping destiny of all creatures below and above, to a measure he himself never would have considered possible.~
@1341 = ~(snort!) Shaping destiny, good man, but not the way I wanted it, or would you allege my doing to have any impact on saving the drow from their evilness? <CHARNAME>, let us go, before I start listening to this babbling and actually believing to have an imact on this world.~
@1342 = ~What a choice to make for a mortal! You need to be a god to understand *what* you are chosing. Until then, it's your own imagination and vanity that tipps the scales to either side.~
@1343 = ~With the power you reached, you already are the most godlike mortal I can imagine. Going there might not as big a step as it seems. Just remember that there is no way back. I will not forget your help, <CHARNAME>. I wish you well.~
@1344 = ~(snort!) You know, I had pondered extensively, worried even, whether my presence in your group would provoke disproportionate hostile reactions from the surfacers.~ [c#ablank]
@1345 = ~After what happened, I realize that I am not necessary for this. You yourself provoke far stronger reactions than my presence ever could have caused.~
@1346 = ~Are you referring to what happened at the oasis?~
@1347 = ~We both carry a difficult legacy, so to speak. Mine is of divine origin, however, so it is only natural that it would cause greater impact.~
@1348 = ~That I provoke hostile reactions is something you've only just noticed? It has happened all the time!~
@1349 = ~Is that all you have to say to this? We had to kill a whole army of knights!~
@1350 = ~Is that all you have to say to this? We nearly had to kill a whole army of knights!~
@1351 = ~Of course! What else would I be referring to? Surely not the other children of Bhaal, coming for your essence.~
@1352 = ~You just said it, <CHARNAME>: had to. Out of the right to defend our own lives.~
@1353 = ~Individual enemies, yes. Opponents who chose to fight you, yes. Monsters, yes. But an entire city, an entire country represented by an order, that's another dimension.~
@1354 = ~Your heritage does not show in your face, unlike mine. Perhaps this is the reason why your fellow surface beings react all the more strongly when they hear about it?~
@1355 = ~Are you taking the stubbornness of these self-appointed avengers to heart? It's not your fault they chose death.~
@1356 = ~Free yourself from the thought that you could direct the destinies of individuals. You are playing with everyone's fate and will influence it. But you still do not have the power to stop individuals from their foolishness, and no one is expecting you to.~
@1357 = ~Thank you for the encouragement.~
@1358 = ~Don't worry. I know it wasn't my mistake.~
@1359 = ~That's supposed to reassure me?~
@1360 = ~This is just my view of things.~
@1361 = ~But to return to the subject at hand...~
@1362 = ~It's more that *I* should consider whether I am putting myself in danger by being around you.~
@1363 = ~I guess you do.~
@1364 = ~Solaufein, it's not like this started yesterday. You should have noticed by now that I'm not the average surfacer.~
@1365 = ~So what?~
@1366 = ~That's right. I also mentioned that you're a little too special for me in that respect.~
@1367 = ~I'm not saying I'm considering it. Too much connects me with you, even if it is only my sense of duty, awakened by your example, to assist you in your struggle out of gratitude for my rescue from the drider chambers.~
@1368 = ~Though I'd rather give our friendship as a reason, to be honest.~
@1369 = ~But it is worth a thought, you must admit? I have not quite given up my centuries-long drill of weighing my own advantages, even if I don't act accordingly.~
@1370 = ~And even more spiders...~
@1371 = ~Just in case anyone wondered: no, I do not feel at home amongst them. Let us kill this vermin and go on.~

/* C#SOLAU_PID.D */
@1372 = ~Let... me be, <CHARNAME>.~
@1373 = ~Hmph. What is it, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@1374 = ~You are very quiet lately...~
@1375 = ~Are you talking to me now?~
@1376 = ~Do you think I want something from you?~
@1377 = ~Solaufein, can I help you in any way?~
@1378 = ~Never mind.~
@1379 = ~Am I imagining things?~
@1380 = ~Don't talk to me like that!~
@1381 = ~I posed my question because of your glance towards me.~
@1382 = ~Do you miss my lamenting and whining about surface adversities?~
@1383 = ~What exactly is troubling you?~
@1384 = ~If you want to call it that. You are unusually surly.~
@1385 = ~What are you trying to hide behind your sarcasm, Solaufein?~
@1386 = ~You are asking me this directly? Is this a sign of... sympathy?~
@1387 = ~Yes, I guess it is. I like your words' symbolic gesture, <CHARNAME>, but there is nothing more for me to tell you than what I already did.~
@1388 = ~Well, I guess I have to accept this answer.~
@1389 = ~Maybe I was wrong.~
@1390 = ~If you say so, solaufein.~
@1391 = ~Let me return to training my abilities, <CHARNAME>. It will serve you more than to poke me about my emotions!~
@1392 = ~The emotions you are confronted with are new to you. I can help you with this.~
@1393 = ~You are behaving differently than before... more dismissive. It worries me to see this!~
@1394 = ~Hmph!~
@1395 = ~I'm trying to cope with my inadequacies since leaving the Underdark. If you don't know what I am referring to, then you didn't listen much to what I was saying lately!~
@1396 = ~You mean compared to the charming person I was before?~
@1397 = ~What do you want?~ [c#ablank]
@1398 = ~(You raise your hand to remove a fluff out of Solaufein's hair.)~
@1399 = ~Would you die for me, Solaufein?~
@1400 = ~How could you secretely deny the drow culture and yet raise to such a high rank inside the Male Fighters' Society?~
@1401 = ~Did you have to pretend a lot to prevent your secret believes to be revieled in Ust Natha?~
@1402 = ~When did you finally realize you are detesting drow traditions?~
@1403 = ~Did you have to make errands for Phaere all the time, Solaufein?~
@1404 = ~Solaufein, if one of us touches your arm to stress what he or she is talking about, how does it feel for you?~
@1405 = ~Solaufein, were there role models for your life? Drow who assisted and supported you, and helped you realize the cruelty of drow culture?~
@1406 = ~I guess you didn't expect to be taken to hell when joining me?~
@1407 = ~I have a question about something that happened in Ust Natha.~
@1408 = ~With the faked eggs you also worked towards the fall of house Despana. I am mentioning this because I have the impression this knowledge is important to you.~
@1409 = ~I can't get the thought about you and an offer about love services out of my mind, Solaufein...~
@1410 = ~You mentioned Handmaidens of Lolth pursuing renegades. Do you expect an ambush at some point?~
@1411 = ~Are you sure you do not wish us to look for more followers of Eilistraee's?~
@1412 = ~You said your magic is nearly gone. But you still have magic abilities!~
@1413 = ~Tell me something about drow culture, Solaufein.~
@1414 = ~So, what is your impression about life on the surface so far, Solaufein?~
@1415 = ~Now you are still travelling with me...~
@1416 = ~Now you are travelling with me...~
@1417 = ~So... You left the Underdark to come to the surface with me, and all I drag you to is the darks of hell, as it seems.~
@1418 = ~Is there something on your mind?~
@1419 = ~Is the sun bothering you? Do you wish us to look for a shady spot and go on travelling tonight?~
@1420 = ~There will be many wary people in the cities. I expect you to wear a cape and hide your face as well as possible.~
@1421 = ~Solaufein, I do not wish to be bothered with your talking any more. You are in this group as a fighter, nothing more.~
@1422 = ~Nothing, Solaufein.~
@1423 = ~Ask.~
@1424 = ~What did you know about Irenicus' and Bodhi's plans in the Underdark?~
@1425 = ~Why were you still in Ust Natha if most other fighters were busy preparing for the war on the surface?~
@1426 = ~Why did you expect me to rescue you from being turned into a drider?~
@1427 = ~About your almost being a drider...~
@1428 = ~I am so glad you told me about the hiding place of the rune stone to the drider chambers. I couldn't have rescued you otherwise!~
@1429 = ~You said you would have liked to see Phaere's face when she realized our betrayal. Did you really hate her that much?~
@1430 = ~Nothing.~
@1431 = ~What do you want to know?~
@1432 = ~Tell me about your goddess Eilistraee.~
@1433 = ~Hm, dancing for Eilistraee means naked in the moon light, as far as I know...~
@1434 = ~Why does Eilistraee like drow to dance naked, in your opinion?~
@1435 = ~Tell me about driders.~
@1436 = ~Tell me about drow, Solaufein.~
@1437 = ~What do you think where all the evil, all the cruelty of your people came from, Solaufein?~
@1438 = ~Upon entering Ust Natha we witnessed a scene where a mother killed her son - saying 'sons I have enough, but where will I get a new well-trained slave from?'~
@1439 = ~I understood very well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1440 = ~(snort!) If you want to call my very personal game of revenge by this...~
@1441 = ~Was it meant as a compliment? Believe me, house Despana would have fallen no matter what after the demon didn't get the eggs. I understood quickly that you would see to this.~
@1442 = ~Do not think too highly about my aims in this matter, <CHARNAME>. Why, do you think, I had fake eggs made? But yes, it is true I gave them to you very willingly after realizing that you would be at the very place where I longed to be - to see Phaere fall.~
@1443 = ~Oh yes, there were. Phaere, Ardulace, Imrae...~
@1444 = ~Oh, you didn't refer to them? But yes, <CHARNAME>. It were these drow who opened my eyes to the cruelty of my people. In case you were referring to a father like Drizzt had - no, there was no such role model for me.~
@1445 = ~Keep in mind my believes are the reult of centuries of revulsion and sullenness. Until then, I lived loyally to the dogmas of Lolth.~
@1446 = ~Well, I can only watch those we encounter until they see me clearly... After that their behavior is reclusive to hostile, the way I am used to. I can't blame them.~
@1447 = ~But I am travelling under your protection, which you granted me so far without hesitation.~
@1448 = ~Well, I guess it's the best I can expect.~
@1449 = ~So much life in your cities!~
@1450 = ~In Ust Natha all there was were drow, spiders, slaves, illithides... and spiders. No shouting other than from angry Handmaidens or high ranked females. No laughing. But cries of pain and agony.~
@1451 = ~I hear cries here, too, but it's the shouting of many individuals, used to proclaim their opinions. And there is just as much laughter, too.~
@1452 = ~Especially from the children. I... didn't know children laugh so much.~
@1453 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have now been able to observe various other surfacers in the city. Some were impatient with each other and their children. Some were kind to each other, even tender...~
@1454 = ~A man kissed his wife. She smiled... Only the official partner can do that, right? It was a gesture of affection, but also of possession.~
@1455 = ~I... confess that I like this gesture much better than anything the drow have come up with for this.~
@1456 = ~I only now realize that what I said was not true at all.~
@1457 = ~I had seen kindness as softness and therefore as a certain weakness. Only now do I see that open togetherness requires a much greater strength.~
@1458 = ~You surfacers speak your mind even if it might be forward or downright offensive. You stand by it, even if it might be reprimanding for someone else. This requires steadfastness, self-confidence, and a self-conception that is driven out of drow from an early age.~
@1459 = ~Oh, but you are no less direct, and by no means shy to speak your mind.~
@1460 = ~I don't know. Here, too, there are clear hierarchies that must be adhered to, otherwise your own integrity is in danger.~
@1461 = ~Don't the drow ever talk back?~
@1462 = ~So what is your conclusion?~
@1463 = ~What exactly do you mean by talking back? A drow will take care not to contradict his mistress, if he wants to preserve his integrity.~
@1464 = ~We drow have no problem speaking overbearingly to those we think we are superior to, and by definition we are superior to all surfacers! At least that would be the answer that a confident drow would give you, I suppose.~
@1465 = ~But I also knew when I could talk back - and when it was best to remain silent. I was supported by a strong house for a long time, you get accustomed to that. I am no longer the youngest and have experienced a number of things that have lessened my fear of reprisals.~
@1466 = ~Maybe I'm just so old that I'm suffering from senile dementia, as it happens with some males, if they survive that long. There were a few who could do and say what they wanted without being prosecuted because they were no longer a danger.~
@1467 = ~Kowtowing to the authorities, intimidation and lies I have seen enough on the surface as well, of course. But all in all, what I said is true.~
@1468 = ~The drow may be strong as a race, and spread fear and terror through merciless brutality. But taken as a single individual, you show far greater strength.~
@1469 = ~In the lower realm I could see in the darkness the warmth shading of the rocks and hide in them. Here on the surface in the light of the sun everything is just hot, hot, hot!~
@1470 = ~I've seen the looks the others give me.~
@1471 = ~I won't find trust among surfacers.~
@1472 = ~That's not the way I'm looking at you, Solaufein.~
@1473 = ~Maybe, maybe not.~
@1474 = ~Pfft. You conclude that by seeing strangers being wary of an unknown drow? Are you not perhaps asking a little much?~
@1475 = ~I know I have your trust, and I'm honored. But will strangers ever regard me with anything but suspicion?~
@1476 = ~That is true, and you show a certain interest in my concerns.~
@1477 = ~So you say, but your dealings with me are shaped by your prejudices against drow.~
@1478 = ~You accepted me as your travel companion. Maybe I will find trust, but it will take a very long time.~
@1479 = ~The question is whether one human life is long enough. And even the long life of the elves might not be enough to overcome the deep mistrust.~
@1480 = ~The distrust of the surfacers or yours?~
@1481 = ~You have chosen a cumbersome path. But it could still be the more fulfilling one.~
@1482 = ~(snort!) You see the problem.~
@1483 = ~We'll see what happens next.~
@1484 = ~I can't get enough of the families I see walking together in your cities, <CHARNAME>. It will always be a mystery to me what life is like in close contact with one's biological parents.~
@1485 = ~Yes, a sound family is a beautiful thing.~
@1486 = ~You'll find enough children who get maltreated here as well.~
@1487 = ~All that glitters isn't gold.~
@1488 = ~It is by no means the norm for everyone to grow up with both parents.~
@1489 = ~There is little I can show you from my own experience, Solaufein.~
@1490 = ~Sure. And yet there will be more who grow up protected and loved.~
@1491 = ~I'm not naive. I know that a supportive community would be ideal. Here, too, the individual must learn to stand up to others and assert his interests, so much for sure. Each family will have its own method of teaching this to their children.~
@1492 = ~Well, because of my divine father... I guess that makes me quite special.~
@1493 = ~I am a foundling raised by a foster father.~
@1494 = ~I had no family, Solaufein. My father is a dead god, and my mother probably did not conceive me voluntarily, and I did not know her.~
@1495 = ~I had no family, Solaufein. My father is a dead god, and my mother... Well, I did not know her.~
@1496 = ~Both my parents and my foster father are all dead.~
@1497 = ~And yet, in percentage terms, there will be more families in which the parents themselves raise their children than those in which this is not the case.~
@1498 = ~You are probably right that you did not have a family as is customary for surface people. But your story shows me more than you seem to realize. After all, you *were* taken in.~
@1499 = ~There are no foundlings with the drow, although our upbringing by the Handmaidens would be more than suitable for it. But if no house protects you, you'll end up as spider food. The males even more so than the females. The daughters kill each other later in their quest for power.~
@1500 = ~You are right. I had a home.~
@1501 = ~Don't fool yourself. Gorion took me in because I carry Bhaal's heritage.~
@1502 = ~As a normal child I would not have had this chance.~
@1503 = ~No, that's not good enough. I'm sure there will always be foundlings raised for reasons other than charity.~
@1504 = ~Do you know that? As a normal child, you might have been born into a normal family.~
@1505 = ~You may be right. A child of Bhaal might have received special attention even amongst drow, but it would only have been to the benefit of a Matron Mother, and for as long as the child and his inheritance would have been of use.~
@1506 = ~And yet he can have many reasons that are not called charity, without his motivation being his own gain.~
@1507 = ~From my perspective, you had more family than I ever could have dreamed of as drow, young <PRO_RACE>.~
@1508 = ~My magic *has* diminished.~
@1509 = ~You can still do Dimension Door!~
@1510 = ~You still can bring Darkness to the enemy.~
@1511 = ~You can still cause Faery Fire!~
@1512 = ~You still can Dispell Magic!~
@1513 = ~It must have been impressive to see you fight with your full magic.~
@1514 = ~I never saw you use so powerful magic when we both worked for Phaere.~
@1515 = ~So you say.~
@1516 = ~(snort!) Yes. Once per day. And only as far as my visual range goes. If it wouldn't be so pathetic I could even laugh about it.~
@1517 = ~You call that darkness? I call that dusk. I could inflict darkness upon others so they would not only loose sight but also hearing - their complete orientation! They were *breathing* darkness, <CHARNAME>.~
@1518 = ~Now I call myself lucky if I manage to give the enemy as much blindness as I encounter in your sun myself.~
@1519 = ~I am delighted you even notice the pathetic light I create with this. Maybe it is due to the brightness of your surface world, but I have the impression my fire turned into sparks, the most.~
@1520 = ~Yes. That is the only one that still works as it did before, but I have to focus my whole magic onto it. There were times before when I could draw from nearly endless ressources.~
@1521 = ~Probably, considering I would have fought you as an enemy of the drow, had we meet differently.~
@1522 = ~Because there was no opportunity. Where should I have used it? Against snirflebi? Against devourers? The former are not worth the trouble, and the latter immune to most of it.~
@1523 = ~Our society is organized in 'houses', each led by a Matron Mother. The females have the power. The males are there to please the powerful females, and to fight for them.~
@1524 = ~We are evil and obsessed with power and kill or enslave all beings of other races if we can.~
@1525 = ~The females plot and kill each other. The males serve the females and are killed by them when they arouse their displeasure.~
@1526 = ~That is all there is to say.~
@1527 = ~Families as you know them do not exist for the drow. The mighty females take males in their favor to sire children with them. The children of a house are raised by their older siblings... And sons are no more important to their mothers than slaves. We are the property of the Matron Mother and she decides our fate.~
@1528 = ~Pain, punishment, torture and death are our constant companions, <CHARNAME>. Lolth's Handmaidens are masters at it. The females may have more power, but in the end they are as much subject to this game as the males.~
@1529 = ~It's the Spider Queen, <CHARNAME>. Lolth is evil and power-obsessed. She is ever hungry for victims and insatiable in her cruelty.~
@1530 = ~But the drow themselves are evil. It is not without reason that the Spider Queen holds power over us. We have strayed from the right path. No wonder some drow turn to other gods... albeit mostly inwardly, for Lolth is unpredictable in her anger.~
@1531 = ~Driders are created by the fusion of a spider and a drow. They are created to honor Lolth and live as outcasts afterwards.~
@1532 = ~It's... the ultimate punishment, <CHARNAME> The cruelest thing that can be done to you in Lolth's name. Even being slowly butchered as living spider food is merciful in comparison.~
@1533 = ~I... I cannot put into words what it means to me that you have spared me this fate. Your decision in Ust Natha not to kill me was remarkable. But it was nothing compared to your mercy in sparing me the fate of a drider!~
@1534 = ~Eilistraee is the daughter of Lolth and Corellon Larethian and the sister of Vhaeraun. In order to balance the evil of the dark elves, she banished herself from the circle of the elven gods.~
@1535 = ~She guides her followers to help everyone. She also enjoys music and dance, but not the way it was done in Ust Natha.~
@1536 = ~To fight for those who cannot do it for themselves, <CHARNAME>, how much does this run counter to the customs of the dark elves! I am very happy to be able to serve her better in this regard. I will strive to live up to her teachings.~
@1537 = ~Does this mean that at the next moonlight you will roam the woods unclothed?~
@1538 = ~Thank you for the information, Solaufein.~
@1539 = ~Yes, sure, but be careful not to overdo it!~
@1540 = ~That's not what I meant.~
@1541 = ~As I said before, <CHARNAME>, the music and dances from Ust Natha would not be very... appropriate. I am eager to experience my fellow believers pay homage to Eilistraee.~
@1542 = ~I think it is unlikely that someone from Ust Natha will be sent after me. It is more likely that I will provoke a spontaneous attack if servants of the Spider Queen notice me. This will be no different from the monsters we usually fight.~
@1543 = ~(snort!) If you have any concerns, I will simply practice my reflexes and caution on the enemy surfacers until followers of the Spider Queen might track me down.~
@1544 = ~(snort!) I had indeed not considered that you could act out this part of your paternal inheritance.~
@1545 = ~It may be a coincidence that your enemy has drawn us along with him... But it's really the only logical place for a Bhaal child without a soul, don't you think?~
@1546 = ~It... was my hope that my impression of you was not mistaken. You had already spared my life in Ust Natha and shown some interest in me....~
@1547 = ~(snort!) Before you get too excited: And you were my only chance, so I took it.~
@1548 = ~Yes?~
@1549 = ~The thought that you might be turned into a drider makes me shudder. I would have given anything to save you!~
@1550 = ~I felt it was my duty after you were captured in my presence.~
@1551 = ~Nothing to it. Just don't do it again.~
@1552 = ~(snort!) Not if I can help it!~
@1553 = ~If I didn't know better, I'd say you were suffering from delusions. But I thank you for my rescue, my friend.~ 
@1554 = ~I'm glad you understood my hints.~
@1555 = ~And I am very glad that the cursed Imrae took her hunt so seriously that she obviously did not pay any attention to my words!~
@1556 = ~Anything? To safe someone you don't know? A drow?~
@1557 = ~Duty? To safe someone you don't know, a drow?~
@1558 = ~You mean after you already tasted me in Ust Natha?~
@1559 = ~M-Hm... Exactly.~
@1560 = ~Keep quiet about that, please.~
@1561 = ~I'm sorry that I forced you into the lust chambers in Ust Natha, Solaufein.~
@1562 = ~I... played a role there not to stand out.~
@1563 = ~The memory of it is enough. What makes you think I'd want to do it again?~
@1564 = ~Perhaps we should not talk about this subject any further.~
@1565 = ~You mean after you already spared me in Ust Natha?~
@1566 = ~I'm sorry that I forced you into the lust chambers in Ust Natha, Solaufein.~
@1567 = ~After I finally refused you in Ust Natha, you mean.~
@1568 = ~There will be no repetition.~
@1569 = ~You're uncomfortable with the subject?~
@1570 = ~You were disguised as drow and had to make sure that you would not be discovered.~
@1571 = ~Had you been more gentle with me, I might have seen through your masquerade.~
@1572 = ~Had you not requested for me, I might still have had to be of service to you, who knows?~
@1573 = ~It's past, just like everything else I experienced down there.~
@1574 = ~Thank you for seeing it that way.~
@1575 = ~I... was impressed. You can believe that.~
@1576 = ~Your reluctance was palpable, and it also spoiled my mood.~
@1577 = ~I'm glad it ended this way.~
@1578 = ~That's fine with me.~
@1579 = ~All right, let's drop the subject.~
@1580 = ~In Ust Natha you demanded a service from a drow to a drow.~
@1581 = ~What I was thinking of the other day would have been better suited for you surfacers...~
@1582 = ~(snort!) You don't really want that, <CHARNAME>. Not from me.~
@1583 = ~Have you seriously considered it?~
@1584 = ~And... Just as an experiment, whether I'd be impressed as a surfacer?...~
@1585 = ~What makes you so sure it wouldn't be to my pleasure?~
@1586 = ~I hope so too. I have no desire for it.~
@1587 = ~Indeed. Never suggest such a thing if we're to remain friends.~
@1588 = ~What an idea that you could certainly impress me with that. After all, I served Phaere without her suspecting a thing. I don't seem to be that bad myself!~
@1589 = ~No. When I came to the conclusion that this is the only thing I could think of as a possibility, I decided I need to talk to you.~
@1590 = ~If it had actually happened, it would have been a service, <CHARNAME>, nothing more. I'm not sure you'd have liked that.~
@1591 = ~Aren't you at all curious to know what it would be like with me?~
@1592 = ~And... Not as a service, but as an expression of appreciation and affection? And, ahem, true desire?~
@1593 = ~I don't want it either. I'm just asking why it's out of the question for you.~
@1594 = ~And what if I told you I'm sure I want it?~
@1595 = ~Teach you?! (snort!) How true. As the young <PRO_RACE> that you are, you would have enough years left for the necessary humiliation and torment.~
@1596 = ~Don't be a fool. You do not want to learn this as a profession, <CHARNAME>. Not the cruelties taught to the drow. And that is all I could teach you.~
@1597 = ~Cruelties? I'm shocked to hear that. It's the opposite of what I associate with physical love, Solaufein.~
@1598 = ~It sounds more like I have something to teach you - urgently!~
@1599 = ~Well, proposing to teach me might not have been a good idea. But other than that...?~
@1600 = ~Do you know how young you are compared to me, <CHARNAME>?~
@1601 = ~Is that a problem?~
@1602 = ~No, because you won't tell me your exact age.~
@1603 = ~All the more you could teach me.~
@1604 = ~Perhaps I have a need to replace the customs of the drow with something pleasant. But if so, I have no desire for you to be my teacher in this.~
@1605 = ~And oh, females and higher ranked males enjoy themselves indeed. It is not torture for everyone involved...~
@1606 = ~You were a higher ranked male yourself, Solaufein?...~
@1607 = ~Not my whole life, <CHARNAME>.~
@1608 = ~And after becoming one, I was cursed with enough empathy not to make others do what I hated giving myself.~
@1609 = ~My longing for physical intimacies is very little, <CHARNAME>. And if, then I am old enough not to ask them from a fledgling such as you.~
@1610 = ~You are too young, young <PRO_RACE>. Ask me again after 300 years passed.~
@1611 = ~Ha, I'll be dead longer than alive after that time span!~
@1612 = ~Oh, you are into necrophilia?~
@1613 = ~Very funny, Solaufein.~
@1614 = ~Let me think... you think I'll like getting intimate with doddering old men then?~
@1615 = ~I could meet the wrong person and be spoiled and traumatised. Aren't you the least afraid, don't you feel just a tiny little bit responsible to save me from such a fate? (eye lash flutter)~
@1616 = ~I don't want it either, Solaufein.~
@1617 = ~(snort!) I am such a person, <CHARNAME>, believe me. No, I do not feel responsible, even though I don't think you were asking in earnest.~
@1618 = ~(The corner of Solaufein's mouth twitches briefly.)~
@1619 = ~I see you understood.~
@1620 = ~I only say this because I come from a culture that requests from subordinates to please their leaders in this way, <CHARNAME>. I follow your instructions, so you are my leader.~ 
@1621 = ~But I'm not your subordinate male. I'm your friend. I'm here voluntarily. We are equals.~
@1622 = ~And as a friend, I am entitled not to give you that service.~
@1623 = ~That's convenient.~
@1624 = ~Phaere was surprisingly blind in many ways about you. But, yes, you're right, of course.~
@1625 = ~As I said before, I never seriously considered approaching you this way. I realized the moment I had the thought that it would not bring me closer to my goal, to put it mildly.~
@1626 = ~It's like I said. Meeting Drizzt has given me enough to think about. It won't be wrong to make myself more familiar with the surface before approaching like-minded people.~
@1627 = ~I also understood that we have to regain your soul first.~
@1628 = ~I also understood that we have to fight your battle against the other Bhaal children, first.~
@1629 = ~For your benefit, but also for the good of all others who are near you.~
@1630 = ~Yes, I heard that, too.~
@1631 = ~So, are you going to do it?~
@1632 = ~I don't have the impression there is much moon light around currently, <CHARNAME>.~
@1633 = ~Not necessarily now, you know. There will be, eventually.~
@1634 = ~Of course not! You misinterpreted my words intentionally, I am sure.~
@1635 = ~If you say so.~
@1636 = ~Why should I do that, alone? And while keeping you waiting?~
@1637 = ~Does it matter, if it is for the glory of your goddess?~
@1638 = ~So, no dancing for the praise of your goddess?~
@1639 = ~Thank goodness. I would part with you, would I see you doing anything so foolish.~
@1640 = ~Maybe she wants us to be defenseless. Defenseless and native, like innocent children.~
@1641 = ~I didn't lose hope to overcome the cruelty of my people with reason, though. As much as I worship her and honor her dogmas, I am not old enough to behave like a child.~
@1642 = ~I have Eilisreaee's song in my heart, and that has to suffice until I meet other followers. I do not feel safe enough yet, <CHARNAME>, to strip all my armour and weapons.~
@1643 = ~You strip, and I'll watch your back. (Ahem)...~
@1644 = ~We could dance together... naked.~
@1645 = ~Oh, but you could strip your clothes and dance *with* the weapons. (giggle)~
@1646 = ~You don't feel safe with me?~
@1647 = ~You would watch over one of your fighters dancing naked through the moon light? You are weirder than I thought.~
@1648 = ~Then neither of us would be prepared for an attack, <CHARNAME>.~
@1649 = ~Now you sound like a paladin.~
@1650 = ~You are taking me too seriously!~
@1651 = ~Indeed.~
@1652 = ~Not a paladin, but a highly unsettled drow.~
@1653 = ~I do not mind nudity. I do not mind nudity in front of others, either. But I do mind being unarmed. That is why I think dancing through the moon light alone is rather silly, and should be done in a group of fellow believers, at the least.~
@1654 = ~(flutter your eyelashes) What a pity. I'd enjoy seeing you dancing naked.~
@1655 = ~(snort!) You will be spared to watch me performing this act of self-discovery in the near future, <CHARNAME>.~
@1656 = ~Isn't it obvious? She gave me every reason to in the last two hundred years. The Handmaidens' tentacle rods drove Phaere's feelings for me out just as they did mine for her.~
@1657 = ~I don't believe you if you say you hated her.~
@1658 = ~Didn't you feel sorry for her at all?~
@1659 = ~Do you feel guilty? For not being able to protect her from it, I mean.~
@1660 = ~But wouldn't you love her still, if coincidences wouldn't have been so cruel?~
@1661 = ~Very well, if you say so.~
@1662 = ~I felt sorry about the situation we were in, <CHARNAME>. I was sorry it shouldn't be able for drow to live the way Phaere and I did for a short time.~
@1663 = ~But Phaere... With all sympathy for what was done to her, I understood very well that afterwards, she saw me as a reminder of her flaw, a sign of her weakness and would have preferred for me to vanish sooner than later.~
@1664 = ~Call it as you wish. Detest her, be disgusted by her, trying to avoid her, whatever! It was the intimateness that defined our connection, and nothing of it was left. I didn't love her any more. I'm not a masochist!~
@1665 = ~Protect her... How was I supposed to spare her this fate? The only thing we could have done was trying to run away into the unknown.~
@1666 = ~Do not think this was an option for Phaere! Or for me, for that matter. It was a game we were both fascinated by, and it worked due to Phaere's high rank as a first daughter. We both profited by it. She called a strong and loyal fighter her own, and I had the favor of a high female.~
@1667 = ~Both our ranks and the advantages coming with them would have been without value if running away. We weren't ready to leave behind the possibilities offered to us. Would we have escaped, I guess we would have found a reason to kill each other soon after!~
@1668 = ~All Phaere had left was her ambition. She never had a good judgement, though. She ever only saw her goals and used every possibility she saw for them, and this didn't change for the better afterwards. On the contrary, now she became deeply absorbed in her ideas and couldn't be dissuaded from them unless something very contradictory happened. You remember what we had to free her from at your first meeting with her?...~
@1669 = ~I told me that this was the reason why she got so focussed onto you. A foreign group, presumably from Ched Nassad... and you were with her, at the conjuration ceremony! It takes some ignorance to hand that much power to a group of foreign drow, no matter how young and compliant.~
@1670 = ~But the daughter is a chip off the old block, as you surfacers say. Ardulace permitted your presence in the temple. Seems she fell victim to her own arrogance as well as Phaere's blindness.~
@1671 = ~But it came as it was supposed to. Stubborn as Phaere was she put all her efforts into you, being so nicely available at the times of war preparation. And it came as I always expected: She tripped over her own arrogance.~
@1672 = ~(sigh) But that is past now. Let us continue.~
@1673 = ~If the Handmaidens of Lolth would not have ended our affair, it would have ended differently, and probably to a less comfortable way, <CHARNAME>.~
@1674 = ~Believe me when I say: If there would have been any other ending to Phaere's and my connection, it would have included spiders, driders, and probably death. I don't expect you to understand, but the way it ended was fortunate, for me. Considering the drow society I lived in, and being the male I am, for my survival and my position in my house it was more than fortunate this affair was ended the way it did. Even with the tortures I had to endure over the last centuries. Because I am alive.~
@1675 = ~You didn't answer my question, Solaufein.~
@1676 = ~In a way I did, <CHARNAME>. I answered your question by pointing out that it doesn't stand against the details of reality. But since you insist, I will answer: I do not know what I would have felt for Phaere, were our connection not be discovered by her house.~
@1677 = ~Maybe we would be lovers still. Maybe we would hate each other just the like. Maybe one of us would have killed the other, to mute a potential threat or get rid of a dangerous insider.~
@1678 = ~But with highest probability we would both be dead, betrayed by one of our brothers and sisters, taking advantage of our secret and the vulnerability that comes along with it.~
@1679 = ~I knew that Matron Mother Ardulace had an ally from whom she hoped to profit in her war against the elves. But I neither knew his name nor did I see him.~
@1680 = ~Don't think the House of Despana would have let me in on their schemes. (snort!) Well, as commander of the Male Fighters' Society I was of course involved in the war preparations, but don't think they told me about their secret plans!~
@1681 = ~Hm. Wasn't it the other way around? It was only *because* I held such a high position that I was able to develop an inner rejection and feelings of revulsion without falling victim to them. As a lower male, such an attitude would have brought death to me - or me into the drider chambers.~
@1682 = ~You have to understand: As a secret follower of Eilistraee who despises the customs of the drow, I could never have survived this long otherwise. I would have either been discovered or driven mad.~
@1683 = ~No. I haven't bent to fit, <CHARNAME>. On the contrary, I became deeply absorbed in my task, because I had to hold on to something in order to bear the discrepancy.~
@1684 = ~I dove into my duties as a male fighter because it was the only way to suppress my feeling of dissatisfaction. Only rarely was I made aware of it, when the disgust at what I encountered daily became too great. Then I longed for my Lady Eilistraee with the silver hair.~
@1685 = ~Then I suppressed the feeling again with my eagerness to function. Otherwise I would have gone mad, <CHARNAME>.~
@1686 = ~You may suspect that it was at the moment when the handmaidens pulled away Phaere to maltreat her with the tentacle rods. This was a far-reaching moment, because Phaere had been my chance to escape the everyday cruelties until then.~
@1687 = ~But at that time I was still too deeply rooted in the customs of my people. I looked for another way to calm my thoughts, dove into my being a fighter and nurtured my longing for Eilistraee.~
@1688 = ~All that happened after that were drops that continued to wear away the stone. I was growing discontent... and when you stood before me in the Male Fighters' Society and spared my life, I finally understood that I could turn my back on my people and their delusions. It wasn't just the fact that my life was forfeited and I had to hide. It was also finally the realization that I *wanted* to turn away from the evil practices of my people.~
@1689 = ~(snort!) She would have liked that. Not all the time, fortunately. In fact, I had peace for a while before Ardulace's megalomaniacal plans thinned out the available fighters.~
@1690 = ~If the city hadn't been so short of fighters, I might not have had to free Phaere with you. Well, that must have given them a taste for pushing me around. Or maybe it was because her other favorites were busy preparing for war.~
@1691 = ~But maybe I should be grateful to her in some way. Even... even Phaere's bullying over the years has been good for distracting me. I could channel all my feelings of disgust and anger that would otherwise have burned me.~
@1692 = ~As commander my place was in the city, they probably didn't want to pull out all the able fighters.~
@1693 = ~Or House Despana just wanted me to be close enough to be able to observe me better.~
@1694 = ~Usstan tlun naut yibin!  I am not weak! I... I will manage.~
@1695 = ~Do not worry about me.~
@1696 = ~Hmph. Only a weakling would give in like that.~
@1697 = ~So? Is the sun too bright? Does the poor drow need to take a break in the shadow?~
@1698 = ~I... confess I would prefer a short rest outside the sun, indeed.~
@1699 = ~Your tone is nothing compared to the disdain our slaves face, blinded by the darkness in the Underdark.~
@1700 = ~(Solaufein raises his eyebrows.) That's a question you want to test our friendship with, isn't it?~
@1701 = ~Dying is pointless. There's no reason to die for each other if you're strong enough to defeat the enemy. Kill! I would kill for you.~
@1702 = ~I think I understand the difference, yes. Thank you.~
@1703 = ~That's what you also did for the Matron Mother.~
@1704 = ~And what if I don't want you to?~
@1705 = ~No. For the Matron Mother I had to kill. For you I would do it voluntarily. It is a great difference.~
@1706 = ~If you don't want me to? You mean, when you ask me not to kill someone when I think it's the right thing to do? That's a very good question.~
@1707 = ~And a difficult one to answer. Because if it's very important to me to kill that someone, wouldn't it be up to you as a friend to grant it to me?~
@1708 = ~(Solaufein catches your hand before you can touch his hair.) Forgive me... You didn't mean to harmt me, did you?~
@1709 = ~What? Of course not! I wanted to take something out of your hair.~
@1710 = ~Never mind.~
@1711 = ~I'm a pathetic friend to a surfacer. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1712 = ~Don't fret. You were mistreated for too long to shake off trained behavior in some weeks.~
@1713 = ~I could have just told you. It's on me to apologize.~
@1714 = ~You and your other culture are just exhausting.~
@1715 = ~It is no less exhausting for me to become familiar with your customs.~
@1716 = ~It is, indeed. You speak wise words, my friend.~
@1717 = ~You apologizing to me confuses me. (sighs) I have much to learn, it seems.~
@1718 = ~I see what you tried to take out of my hair. Thank you, I will do it myself.~
@1719 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm centuries old and I've felt everything that causes pain. But there is one thing I have never felt before: touches that should serve no 'purpose'. Who speak of friendship and trust. There's so much you can teach me, young <PRO_RACE>.~
@1720 = ~And to answer your question... Nothing has ever filled me with more joy than your hand on my arm, assuring me that I am still your friend.~
@1721 = ~I will and would have, anyway. I will not gamble with the protection you are granting me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1722 = ~Yes, I ask myself how I survived with the elves without waking up with a knife in my back. They seem to have a lot of faith in their geas. Or trust you enough.~
@1723 = ~But you are referring to the fact that I did not leave when you had your soul back and your enemy was defeated, right? Well, the rapid development of things took us all by surprise. The desire to get to know my bright surface siblings better made me linger, and now we are here.~
@1724 = ~Yes, I will continue to support you. You are my friend.~ 
@1725 = ~(snort!) Moreover, the times of the rioting Bhaal children might not be the best moment to make my people reconsider their evil ways.~
@1726 = ~Yes, I will continue to support you. The times of the rioting Bhaal children might not be the best moment to make my people reconsider their evil ways.~
@1727 = ~Are you asking because I am now travelling with you instead of following my own plans?~
@1728 = ~Well, the times of the rioting Bhaal children might not be the best moment to make my people reconsider their evil ways.~
@1729 = ~These are turbulent times. As long as the Bhaal children fight for their father's throne, the drow will not rest, either. We are all forced to choose one side or the other. I may as well spend this time in your company.~
@1730 = ~For a long time I thought I was already in hell, <CHARNAME>.~
@1731 = ~Then you came and pulled me into the real hell... and taught me here of all places the meaning of friendship.~
@1732 = ~Do you think I only cared about going to the surface? You know my most inner desire: to seek out like-minded people.~
@1733 = ~If you're satisfied, it's fine.~
@1734 = ~Yes, but you won't find them here, either...~
@1735 = ~You think you can do that here?~
@1736 = ~That is true.~
@1737 = ~From your pocket plane we can reach faraway places faster than I ever dreamed.~
@1738 = ~And you like that?~
@1739 = ~It makes me feel like being under someone else's command, not as if it gives me freedom.~
@1740 = ~I can only go where I am supposed to, not where I want to go. I would have gladly led you beneath the city of Waterdeep, to Eilistaee's hidden temple.~
@1741 = ~Your powers give us far more possibilities to reach places, faster and wider spread than anything I would have imagined, even if it takes away the impressions only a far travel can give.~
@1742 = ~I need neither open sky nor the sun to know that I left the hell you call Underdark.~
@1743 = ~And I need neither rain-wet nor murky sleeping places to know that I enjoy the comfort your so-called hell enclave provides.~
@1744 = ~I thank you for considering it.~
@1745 = ~Yes, it does.~
@1746 = ~I understand this Sarevok is a former enemy of yours, and you just restored him to life... I myself benefitted from the same behavior of yours: to spare your former enemies' life. Still, it takes me by surprise.~
@1747 = ~Considering you faught for your soul in hell itself only recently, I feel a little bit... deceived to see you hand parts of it over willingly.~
@1748 = ~That's how I am. If asked nicely, I do a lot for other people.~
@1749 = ~It was Imoen's choice, not mine.~
@1750 = ~The situation was completely different.~
@1751 = ~I don't really understand why I let this happen, either.~
@1752 = ~I had no choice!~
@1753 = ~I don't care how you feel about my decision, Solaufein.~
@1754 = ~That makes more sense than you are implying.~
@1755 = ~That may be.~
@1756 = ~I did criticise your action, but it is of no importance. This Sarevok is no match to you. He could turn into a nuisance, at most.~
@1757 = ~So, the times of Bhaal spawn fighting each other has begun.~
@1758 = ~So it seems.~
@1759 = ~Solaufein, not this topic from you, too!~
@1760 = ~Hm, I fear you'll have to bear it if expecting your comrades to stay with you.~
@1761 = ~So, does the throne of your godly father interest you?~
@1762 = ~Absolutely. The power is in me, and I have a right to it.~
@1763 = ~I'm not sure... It's hard to imagine what it would mean.~
@1764 = ~That is no option. I so wished this wouldn't have anything to do with me!~
@1765 = ~Honestly, Solaufein, not you, too. I feel like I have to have this discussion with everyone at least once.~
@1766 = ~Well, you asked for my thoughts. And even if you'd write it onto a banner and carried it in front of you, I guess you'll be asked this question time and again.~
@1767 = ~Well, we will see how it turns out. I assume there will be quite a bit of work until then for you, though.~
@1768 = ~What is happening to us is mighty. Your godly powers, even the representatives of the gods are coming for you.~
@1769 = ~Bt it is this time - Faern is filled with bloodthirsty children of Bhaal. Everyone is experiencing mighty times. Even in the Underdark it will be the same.~
@1770 = ~But most people are just exposed to the threat and lose their lives. I prefer being with you on this side of things very much.~
@1771 = ~After what I see you doing here, creating this hell enclave, communicating with the gods, I am surprised you didn't wipe Ust Natha off it's hinges while passing through. You are very powerful, <CHARNAME>.~
@1772 = ~When you asked me to join your company, I was unsure you would be able to protect me against all dangers at the surface. That doubt vanished soon as I saw how you cut your way through the drow posts to your way to the exit.~
@1773 = ~When I saw you fight your way through the drow posts, I also knew you didn't spare my life in Ust Natha because you wanted to avoid a fight with a potentially dangerous opponent. I was no match for you even then.~
@1774 = ~Now you are more powerful than anyone I have ever met... and I am old, <CHARNAME>.~
@1775 = ~Maybe, but with my increase in power, even stronger enemies seem to seek me out.~
@1776 = ~That means now you would not hesitate as long to join me, would we meet now?~
@1777 = ~Yes, and I am not finished yet. We need to get going.~
@1778 = ~Now I would hesitate even longer, <CHARNAME>, because I know that I cannot defeat you, would you decide to harm me.~
@1779 = ~I didn't think of that.~
@1780 = ~You know I won't ever do that. We are friends.~
@1781 = ~I would never do that. We are allies.~
@1782 = ~Wise thinking.~
@1783 = ~I won't recite the saying about moths and the light.~
@1784 = ~I don't know you wouldn't do that. But I trust in that you won't.~
@1785 = ~Isn't that what I said?~
@1786 = ~Then we should go.~
@1787 = ~You would, were you in my situation.~
@1788 = ~Not quite. You might not see a difference in our statements, but for me the concept of trust is new, and I feel its power even stronger.~
@1789 = ~This... town is different to what we encountered in Amn.~
@1790 = ~Overall, the behaviour of the common folk in this town reminds me of the one I was used to. It is different, of course. All those monks doing their suppressing as they see fit, you woudn't see those in a drow city. Way too much autonomously lived out actions of power and suppression, no Matron Mother would tolerate that.~
@1791 = ~But the town folk is frightened, careful not to rise any suspicion. That is what I mean. This Balthazar knows how to terrorise a city, I have to grant him that. And he does it without leaving his monastery.~
@1792 = ~(snort!) That's the advantage of a drow city. You don't have to go and search for a way to get to who is in charge of suppressing the inhabitants there.~
/* c#solau.d */
@1793 = ~Solaufein! This is how we meet again?~
@1794 = ~Yes. We have here the eggs of the Lady Adalon and will bring them to safety.~
@1795 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider.~
@1796 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider. I asked him to join me, and he will leave the Underdark on his own and wait for me at the surface, on the South-East of the elf camp.~
@1797 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider. I asked him to join me, and he will come to me before we leave the Underdark.~
@1798 = ~Solaufein's Rescue

I saved Solaufein from being turned into a drider. Alas, he didn't show me how long he would last fighting with two knives. I will not see him again.~

@1800 = ~I can't believe I am travelling with someone like you, Dorn... Evil, brutal, merciless.~
@1801 = ~I could easily free you from this pain, drow.~
@1802 = ~There is a deeper layer in your words, and I do enjoy irony. But sadly, all your words are proving is what I said before.~
@1803 = ~Hexxat, when I heard the term 'creature of the night' the first time, my endless narcissism let me think it's meant for us drow.~
@1804 = ~*Let* me guess what is meant instead.~
@1805 = ~You have three guesses.~
@1806 = ~Dorn, when offering to spare me travelling with you, you didn't mean you would leave the group, did you?~
@1807 = ~No. You know what I was referring to.~
@1808 = ~I think I know, yes. Don't you think <CHARNAME> would have a say in this, too?~
@1809 = ~Afraid?~
@1810 = ~Of you? Dorn, you *know* where I come from, yes?~
@1811 = ~Hexxat, there is a certain... satisfaction to travelling with a creature suffering under the sun even more than oneself.~
@1812 = ~Really? I couldn't tell.~
@1813 = ~A jest! I am stunned.~
@1814 = ~Great, maybe it spares us your whining for a while.~
@1815 = ~That wasn't nice.~
@1816 = ~Did it hurt? Even though it came from a 'creature of the night', from the deeps of the darkness.~
@1817 = ~Oh, there are a lot of things capable to hurt, and more than just a sunburn.~
@1818 = ~Do you always strive to have the final say?~
@1819 = ~Only sometimes.~
@1820 = ~And, Hexxat? Do surfacers taste differently than drow?~
@1821 = ~It depends on where they were living. Everyone kind of develops an own flavor, you know...~
@1822 = ~I had the chance of tasting drow who never left the Underdark. They tasted... muffled, somehow moldered.~
@1823 = ~Is that so? This doesn't sound very flattering. I would have thought the magic would make them thrilling somehow.~
@1824 = ~*Thrilling* I would call the taste of a drow being at the surface for some time... Long enough to have lost the moldered taste, but not long enough to have lost all of his magic.~
@1825 = ~That sounds interesting, indeed. Let me know if you'll find one.~
@1826 = ~A-haha! Ha!~
@1827 = ~You will notice if that'd be the case.~
@1828 = ~You don't say!~
@1829 = ~Ouch! Wilson, no offence, but that was my foot.~
@1830 = ~I do not mind you to be so close to me, at least not until now. If you do continue to trample on my foot, I'll have to re-evaluate your threatening potential, though.~
@1831 = ~It's funny how you surface animals seem to be all soft and fluffy.~
@1832 = ~Compare this hairy beast with what is to be found in the Underdark. It's either scales or slime or carapace all over.~
@1833 = ~You-you are referring to Wilson, yes? Soft and fluffy? I mean, I-I see what you mean, but to call a wild bear soft and fluffy...~
@1834 = ~Oh, Wilson, if you look l-like that... Aren't you the *fluffiest* thing?...~
@1835 = ~Yes, fluffy. They were well sought after in the Underdark, because of their ability to keep warm: bear pelts.~
@1836 = ~AND of course they were a sign of great drow-heroism. But I have to admit it was because the drow had to be on the surface to get the pelt, not necessarily because a bear was seen to be a great threat... Sorry, my friend.~
@1837 = ~Only a creature of the Underdark could call one of the mightiest creatures of the forest soft and fluffy! Wait until the bear shows its teeth and claws!~
@1838 = ~These little pointy things?~
@1839 = ~Wilson, it is a sad truth that a bear's claws and teeth are no comparison to those of, say, a Cavvekan.~
@1840 = ~You mean any Cavvekan is far away, but you are nearby so I should watch my tongue? You do have a point there, Wilson.~
@1841 = ~Wilson, you are right. There is one thing where you keep up with any Cavvekan...~
@1842 = ~The stench.~
@1843 = ~But I do admit that you are a fine beast. And I definitely prefer having you on my side than having you against me.~
/* Sendai's Lair */
@1844 = ~Ah, the Underdark... yes, it feels familiar.~ [c#ablank]

@1863 = ~Is there anything else you have on your mind?~
@1864 = ~Yes, I am surprised that I survived the time in that Elven city without waking up with a knife in my back. They didn't seem to expect much evil from me - or they trusted you well enough.~

@1872  = ~Neera, please keep your distance.~
@1873  = ~What? Me? Why me? You're afraid of *me*?~
@1874  = ~Not you, personally. Wild magic is a powerful thing. Powerful, and... unpredictable. I do not wish to be target to your wild surges.~
@1875  = ~Well, who does... But really? You complained about your loss of magic. And you'd not be grateful if I'd give you some of mine?~
@1876  = ~This remark doesn't make any sense and you know it.~
@1877  = ~Did you tell <CHARNAME> the same thing?~
@1878  = ~<CHARNAME> is our leader and freed me from the drider chambers. I knew what I was getting into when joining <PRO_HIMHER>.~

@1879  = ~Solaufein, you want me to keep my magic to myself?~
@1880  = ~Yourself and our enemies, yes.~
@1881  = ~Unless a wild surge changes my fireball into something good?~
@1882  = ~Unless that, yes.~
@1883  = ~Well, what can I say. At least I still *have* my magic?~
@1884  = ~(scoff) Very true. And well spoken.~

@1885  = ~Neera, I shouldn't scold the unpredictability of your magic. With most of my magic lost, I can relate to one's magic being unreliable very much.~
@1886  = ~Was that an apology? I take it as an apology. The drow said 'I'm sorry' to me!~
@1887  = ~If you want to see it that way. It was a true statement, at least. Although I guess having powerful magic that is unpredictable is even worse than my condition. This is an interesting thought I have to ponder on.~
@1888 = ~Ohh, and that sounded very much like thanking me for a very insightful thought. I am thrilled! The drow said 'sorry' and 'thank you' in the same conversation!~

@1889 = ~Neera, how do *you* deal with the frustration the unpredictability of your magic holds?~
@1890 = ~Well, there was a time were I was searching for an answer to make it more predictable. But life is tough and unfair, because there is none, really. So I braced myself and keep on telling me that *every* spell tends to wear off after some time. And also, I always have some nuts and bisquits in my backpack, just in case...~
@1891 = ~And, what can I say - at least I still *have* my magic?~
@1892 = ~(snort!) I remember that one. I see that your problems are different than mine, or at least does your strategy, if I call it that, not help me in my condition. I thank you for your answer, nontheless.~

@1893  = ~Wilson, as much as I am surprised to find myself conversing with a bear, I have to put something straight. I might have been ready to complain about your stench, my good beast. Until I noticed that - given several days in a row on sunny, dusty roads following night camps in the wilderness... none of us has a right to complain to you any more.~
@1894  = ~Exactly.~

@1895  = ~It is surprising to think of *how* convincing the silver dragon's illusion was.~

@1897  = ~I saw you and <CHARNAME> fight in the Underdark, Rasaad, but it never occurred to me that it is monks' movements I am looking at.~
@1898  = ~We were lucky then... This way of fighting never struck you as odd?~
@1899  = ~It did feel odd to me, but I thought you'd be a specially trained male some paranoid - or wise, depending on perspective - Matron Mother raised to have protection in a 'no weapon' zone, or that you yourself were aiming at a matron to impress her with your weaponless fight. I also noticed very quickly that you are good at what you are doing, so I didn't see a reason to talk about it.~
@1900  = ~Never it occurred to me that I might be looking at a deception.~
@1901  = ~Perhaps this was one of the reasons the illusion was so powerful - because it presented us in a way noone even considered a deception.~
@1902  = ~You mean if it looks like a drow and talks like a drow just right enough, even our people's very own suspiciousness doesn't suffice to make us questioning whether it actually would *be* a drow? Well, that would fit nicely to my opinion that my race is blinded by its own arrogance.~

@1903  = ~Dorn, I am even more surprised finding myself travelling with you *still*.~
@1904  = ~You thought <CHARNAME> would chose between us?~
@1905  = ~Actually, I was more expecting that I would have to kill you at some point.~
@1906  = ~Pfeh. We could still see how that would turn out, drow.~
@1907  = ~I'm not so sure any more that it will come to this, to be honest, if it hasn't yet. And - we do have other problems, currently. But yes, I would be ready.~
@1908  = ~As am I.~
@1909  = ~I know.~

@1910  = ~Rasaad, I do say it still puzzles me how a man can fight with nothing but his fists.~
@1911  = ~It's power granted by the gods. In return, a monk hands himself to his god completely - including the vow to never wield a weapon other than his god's power.~
@1912  = ~I do understand that it is comparable with the magic a priest has at his disposal, but still - the combination of magic with your own body force still strikes me as unordinary. I liked being able to wield magic, but nothing compares to a good weapon in my hand. Without it, I would feel naked.~

@1913  = ~Solaufein, you think me a smaller threat because I use no weapons?~
@1914  = ~On the contrary. I understand very well that you *are* your weapon. Thinking about it even makes me a bit uneasy - an armed man can be *unarmed*, at least. A mage can be stopped by a no magic zone. But you? You are unstoppable.~
@1915  = ~Unless I lose my god's blessing...~
@1916  = ~Unless this, but that, my friend, is a different thing altogether, I would assume.~

@1917  = ~Rasaad, would it be appropriate to ask you to show me some of your fighting moves?~
@1918  = ~Well, I can show you some if you want, but I doubt you will be able to perform them with the strength necessary - the strength a monk was granted by his god.~
@1919  = ~I agree, but nevertheless, a physically strong person should be able to use them beneficially if fighting unarmed.~
@1920  = ~Very well. Put your feet like this...~
@1921  = ~You do have a lot of strength and do not hesitate to use it, but you are missing some of the acrobatics needed, especially for the kicks.~
@1922  = ~Indeed, I do... How do you prevent the edge of the hand to burn after hitting with it repeatedly?~
@1923  = ~I don't, because mine doesn't burn any more - but before, I trained until it stopped.~
@1924  = ~I see. I always thought my body is used to being maltreated in any way possible, but I see now that there are still ways to go, if I want to become as hardened as you.~
@1925  = ~Only in this regard. Let me swing a sword and hold a shield for some hours, and I am very sure my muscles would ache and shake all over.~
@1926  = ~You mean it is always what we are used to that determines what we are capable of? This sounds like a very wise statement - and still leaves room for hope that we are capable of shaping our own lifes if we invest enough dedication.
