# Solaufein's Rescue - jastey's Solaufein NPC mod for BGII
NPC mod for BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET!

With this modification the game character Solaufein, drow fighter from Ust Natha, is extended to a joinable NPC. Before he can join, Solaufein has to be freed from drider chambers. This starting quest can be played independently to whether he should then join the group or not.
 
Compatibility with Weimers Solaufein for this case is described below in detail.

Solaufein can also follow as a '7th party member' in case your group already consists of 6 persons. More details about this please refer to readme.

The second, optional mod component offers the possibility to give the game Solaufein in Ust Natha the mod's portrait. If you want to see this in the game, this component has to be installed after Weimer's Solaufein.

The third, optional component is for BGII and BGT: If the main component of Infinity Animations (link see below section "LINKS") is installed, this component will install and use the drider animations for the mod. 
Without this component, all driders in the mod will be displayed as drow. There is no loss in gameplay, other than it won't look as nice. :-) 
For BGII:EE and EET the animations will be included and used automatically.

The forth, optional component enables to install the alternative portrait for Solaufein, also from Holger Kirste!

The fifth, optional component adds one additonal reply option to Adalon's dialogue, with which the player can tell that the PC is drow. This will set a variable so that Solaufein will address the PC as drow. This was content of the main component before but I made it a separate component for v2 because it might be immersion breaking in case players do not plan on playing as drow PC. The detection of the subrace mods mentioned above is independent to this.


For version 2 (and higher), the English version is complete!
